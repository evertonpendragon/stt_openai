       "[\" #MURDER BY MOONLIGHT\\n Standing in sopping fields of stinking mud, Lord-Celestant Gardus of the Steel Souls drove a nagging worry from his mind.\\n Not fear. Never fear. This was more tedious. Disquiet: incessant, parasitic, gnawing. It rasped at the shield of his patience, clawing at the armour of his calm, urging him to harken.\\n This is not the war you were forged for. And this is not the battle you sought.\\n Gardus returned his attention to the mortals, who had almost finished their ministrations to the dead. Rows of fallen comrades surrounded them. Islands of naked orruk corpses dotted the flooded killing fields. The hungry silt bed pulled at them in sedate pulses, drawing the slain down towards the shale maws said to feast below. Ghur hungered, always.\\n Heavy boot-falls thudded closer. Retributor-Prime Feros of the Heavy Hand slogged to Gardus' side. Feros was a formidable tower of plate and muscle, as steady as the Stormcasts came.\\n 'Grey skies, grey lands, grey souls. And rain without end.' Feros shouldered his hammer, and its head spat with the play of mist on lightning. 'I am grateful to serve the God-King, Lord-Celestant, but this is not a war I would have asked for.'\\n Gardus suppressed a grim smile beneath his stern-faced mask. The Heavy Hand's protestations were like an old blanket, welcome and warm in these cold lands. 'Take pride, Feros. We bring faith and salvation to the Claw's Eye clans. We have endured far worse than this.'\\n 'Aye, what I'd do for worse.' Savage nostalgia underpinned Feros' bass growl. 'Ghyran, lord. Or Gravewild. Those were battles of renown.'\\n Together they watched the Freeguild guardsmen and Claw's Eye warriors finish their tallies of the dead. The guardsmen placed sigmarite talismans upon the fallen, reminders of the cause they served, and which served them.\\n The talismans were gift from the Steel Souls. Gardus' chamber had come here not merely to protect the Claw's Eye clans, but also to return them to the fold of Sigmar's worship. The Reclaimed must be made to understand that Sigmar would protect them. He would not have sent Stormcasts otherwise.\\n The mortals muttered in their motley tongues, brushing obsessively at their exposed flesh lest an insistent native fungus take root. A mildewed fug blanketed the lands. Mushrooms flowered in the silt beds, on the dead, feeding on whatever would nourish them. The fungus was another realisation of Ghur's ravenous nature, Gardus suspected. But even the Claw's Eye clans didn't know where it came from.\\n A cry echoed across the fields, passing from the road on the ridge to the guardsmen scavenging and prowling in the mud.\\n 'More orruks in the lowlands, I reckon,' Feros rumbled. 'They summon the lord of the Stormcasts.'\\n Gardus straightened, moving with the inevitability of an iceberg adrift. 'No. This is something else.'\\n A mule-pulled cart trundled closer. From Excelsis, judging by the tack. Beside it, a daughter of Ghur shouted at dog-tired guardsmen and sinewy clansmen in baggy trousers. The soldiery tried to calm her, but that only caused the woman to raise her voice. She demanded to see him.\\n Intrigued, he made his way to the ridge. Something about the Ghur-daughter felt familiar. Not her clean, threadbare dress, nor her hair the shade of straw from Azyrite blood. Nor indeed her fairness, which belied obvious strength. She looked like she could have pulled the cart she came with faster than its mules.\\n The straw-haired Ghur-daughter dug a kerchief into her wrinkleless hands, brushing the crevices of her nails before meeting Gardus' gaze. Her eyes were bluff but sincere. 'Lord of the Stormcasts?'\\n 'I am Lord-Celestant Gardus, of the Steel Souls.' He glanced to her kerchief, to the smears of blood bronzed from exposure. A leather roll of surgeon's instruments was slung over her shoulder.\\n She was a physician. Perhaps an army surgeon with one of the Freeguilds, but certainly a healer.\\n\",\n",
       " \"Another bout of fickle rain sighed across the battlefield. Gardus glanced into the cart, at another woman with two armfuls of children, all of them weeping.\\n The doctor within Gardus – Garridan of Demesnus, that fallen hero of a bygone age, plucked from death's clutches by the God-King himself – sensed something deeply wrong.\\n He unclasped his helm and knelt, letting the road's filth seep into his finely worked greaves. Better the mortals see the human rather than the hero. A goliath, with an unshorn mane of ivory-white hair and starlight in the depths of him. But nevertheless human. Nevertheless kind.\\n 'You are troubled,' Gardus told the mourners. He held out a talisman, one of those his chamber distributed to the local warriors. 'Take heart. Sigmar protects his faithful. We are here for you.'\\n Terror stricken, the woman in the cart recoiled. Her children grew inconsolable. They clasped at their mother, drawing away from Gardus.\\n 'The man of their house was murdered, my lord,' the straw-haired healer said. 'In Claw's Eye, after eventide, under the light of the Beast-Moons.'\\n Gardus turned and regarded her. Her tone was hard, sharp, like an old hunting knife slicing its master's thumb. Purpose filled her poise, but grace did, too.\\n And accusation.\\n 'That is regrettable,' Gardus said sincerely. 'But it does not concern a Lord-Celestant of the Hallowed Knights.'\\n 'It does, my lord.' The Ghur-daughter raised her voice for all to hear. She was like a quarrel in flight to its target's heart. She would not be deterred. 'Because I believe one of your warriors did it. One of your Stormcast Eternals. And this murder was not their first.'\\n The healer's name was Omat. As Gardus predicted, she was a physician from Excelsis, but no army surgeon. Omat wandered the realm tending to Sigmar's faithful. Like the Steel Souls, she had come to this part of Ghur to bring faith to the Reclaimed of Claw's Eye. She had a scholar's polish and a mother's drive.\\n 'These killings have haunted the region since I've been here,' she said on the road back to the keep. Her manner was kind but direct, and something about her reminded Gardus of well-washed hands. 'I've seen the victims myself, lord. Before the settlers and clansmen sought refuge in Claw's Eye. Of this latest killing in the caves, I learned just before the watch came. It was only by the grace of Sigmar I was there to tell them.'\\n 'Tell them what?' Gardus asked.\\n Omat's eyes glimmered. She was old beyond her years. Empathetic. But Gardus knew better than most that empathy was a twice-cutting blade.\\n 'These murders occur where your warriors pass, my lord,' Omat said. 'This cannot be a coincidence. And I have proof it is not.'\\n Soon, the silhouette of a rural castle jutted into the marble skies. Claw's Eye, a hill fort raised by some forgotten kingdom, then squatted in by their forever-diminishing successors, before finally Ghurish clans and a slew of Excelsis' crusaders colonised and restored the keep.\\n From without, Claw's Eye appeared like any other minor castle town. A keep sitting on a prominence of bone-hard bedrock behind a weatherworn sandstone bailey, reinforced by limestone and timber. Wattle-and-daub buildings studded the foot of the crags below, a village of somnolent craftsmen and suffocating prosperity.\\n Behind the gates of Claw's Eye lay the secret of it – a labyrinth of old caverns, carved deep below the crust of Ghur. Ragged stone viaducts criss-crossed a gaping chasm, connecting hewn cliff faces of tiered stone galleries, each lined with chambers, oubliettes, tunnels and stubborn gloom.\\n\",\n",
       " \"None had explored the full depths of the caverns, but that expansiveness had proved a blessing. Refugees had fled to Claw's Eye en masse ever since the orruk warclans rallied and the Stormcasts lanced down from the sky to cull them. The dispossessed now filled the cave passages. They spilled from their meagre apartments into the winding streets, their belongings heaped up on corners and nooks, wherever the castle wardens tolerated them. Only the Temple of Sigmar, cantilevered over the yawning hollow like a madman's gamble, remained untouched by refugees.\\n Omat led Gardus into the labyrinth below, to an unremarkable chamber. Encased in bulky war plate, the Lord-Celestant didn't fit in the cramped hovel so much as stuff it. He ducked below chipped crockery dangling from uneven slats and sidled past woven-reed baskets hanging from bent nails. How a family had called this home, he wasn't sure.\\n Omat eased up to a table bearing a human-shaped roll of burlap.\\n 'The victim?' Gardus asked.\\n Omat nodded.\\n Gardus frowned. Some part of him had hoped Omat had been mistaken. The Steel Souls were supposed to bring salvation to the troubled sanctuary of Claw's Eye. Not this.\\n Then again, Omat hadn't divulged the whole story. She hadn't even provided proof of her claims.\\n 'Explain what you've found,' Gardus said. 'Leave nothing out.'\\n Omat crept around the table, tucking her bloodstained kerchief into the waist of her skirts. 'I've spent my years wandering, my lord. I attend to those I can, often too late to be of any use, save to determine cause of death.' She made the sign of the hammer. 'Usually, I deal with fallen brutes in tavern brawls, or the sick and the frail. But lately, innocents like these. Take a look.'\\n She threw back the burlap, and Gardus leaned in.\\n The victim, poor soul, had hardly reached manhood. His unblemished skin was as grey as the monsoon horizon. A deep incision laid his throat open like a canyon. The bloodless gash glared up at Gardus like a wretched smile.\\n Gardus grimaced. 'This occurred under the Beast-Moons?'\\n 'Yes, at their zenith.'\\n That could not be coincidence. 'Is that uncommon?'\\n Omat shook her head, brushing strands of hair behind her ear. '“The Wolf's Glare”, the clansmen call it. It occurs every seventeen days, like clockwork.'\\n Gardus stared. If a Stormcast was indeed responsible for this, the matter must be addressed delicately.\\n If.\\n 'You've inspected the other victims?' he asked.\\n Omat nodded.\\n 'And timing aside, what proof do you have one of Sigmar's chosen is committing these heinous acts?' Nothing about the slash in the boy's throat reminded Gardus of a runeblade's edge. The cut was too clean. The boy's head was still on his shoulders.\\n Omat hesitated. 'That talisman you offered the woman and her children, my lord. I've seen them around this region. Warhammers, cast in alloyed sigmarite.' She sized them out with her hands. 'Tiny, rough-shaped. Tokens of the God-King's vigilance, yes?'\\n 'We are warriors, Omat,' Gardus said. 'And many things besides. Our mission here is not only one of war. We offer the Claw's Eye clans the sanctuary which faith provides. Faith in the God-King's purpose, his works.'\\n Omat lowered a gentle hand to the burlap and tugged the scrim back.\\n Resting on the man's belly, between his clasped fingers, was one of the very talismans Omat and Gardus spoke of. It was burnished and bright, save for the unsettling blemish of hardened blood.\\n 'Anybody could have left that,' Gardus said.\\n Omat narrowed her eyes, trenchant and brave. 'And tell me, my lord, who else would have left it? The orruks? Or the fallen who inherit these tokens?'\\n 'Why would a Stormcast have left this?' Gardus asked.\\n Omat inhaled deeply. 'I believe it's like a signet, lord. Left behind to mark the deed, or bring honour to Sigmar.' Again, she made the sign of the hammer.\\n 'Wanton killing brings no honour to Sigmar,' Gardus said. 'You hail from Excelsis, but we are not Knights Excelsior.'\\n\",\n",
       " \"'I make no claim to know you, my lord. But respectfully, such cues left behind are common after murders like these. And whatever is spoken of your kind, you are still human, deep down. And I have heard whispers your soul forging can… change you.'\\n Gardus understood Omat's thrust. 'Who else knows of this, healer?'\\n Omat darkened. 'I didn't mean to–'\\n 'Who else?' Gardus repeated.\\n Omat's eyes smoothed. 'As I said. The watch. And I mentioned the other cases, all with their own talismans…' She blinked, then met Gardus' gaze. 'The whispers are already spreading throughout Claw's Eye, lord. That Sigmar's chosen bring not salvation, but death. And to be honest…'\\n Gardus leaned back. 'You believe it, too.'\\n 'It is difficult to get around the timing and the talismans, my lord.'\\n 'And the locations, if this only occurs in settlements we've passed through.' Gardus frowned. 'How many other cases have you discovered?'\\n She told him, and he didn't believe his ears.\\n Gardus felt disconsolate. 'You studied in Excelsis?'\\n 'At the Lycaeum, lord. In the Noble Quarter.'\\n The Lycaeum of Excelsis was famed for many reasons, and Gardus had heard its name more than once, even as a mortal.\\n Omat was educated and reliable, then. An expert.\\n 'When the watch found me,' Omat said, 'I suggested they raise the matter elsewhere. With the Grand Conclave of Excelsis, perhaps. If the killer really was one of yours, I didn't trust bringing this up with you. But the Claw's Eye clans and the watchmen, they say you're a legend. A man of repute, and kindness. Or, if not a man–'\\n 'Please,' Gardus demurred. 'I am certainly no god.'\\n She nodded. 'I mean to say I trust repute, lord. I trust kindness.'\\n Despite his scepticism, Gardus trusted Omat, too. It was hard not to. Omat somehow reminded him of what he could have been an age ago, if Garridan of Demesnus hadn't died a hero.\\n But Garridan was gone. No more than a half-remembered saint in a tumbledown fishing port, a smattering of inconstant flashes from a past bleeding away from him, and the remembered weight of old candlesticks in unfaltering hands.\\n Gardus edged away from the table, careful not to scrape his armour along the smoke-stained ceiling. He stared at a brace of fungus hanging in the corner like a huntsman's trophy antlers. 'You bring dark tidings, healer,' he said. 'Much is at stake in Claw's Eye. We cannot lose the clans' trust.' He peered at the victim. 'This isn't right.'\\n Omat replaced the burlap. 'There's a host of things not-right in the realms, my lord. This would not be the first of them.'\\n 'You've seen your share, I imagine.'\\n Gloom poisoned Omat's countenance. 'As a child, I went picking mushrooms with my brother one night. Mother kissed us farewell. Father told us to be safe. We fell asleep by the river, then came back before dawn. Our village had been attacked by grots.' She shivered. 'I picked up the pieces of them, hoping Sigmar would put them back together again. Like you.'\\n Garridan's mortal life had ended in such an atrocity. Gardus couldn't imagine the misery of surviving that. This Ghur-daughter and he were the same, but for a quirk of fate.\\n 'You have my condolences,' he said. 'That is a tribulation no mortal should have to endure.'\\n Omat's lips thinned. 'Yes. I know, lord. I grew up an orphan in Excelsis, staring at the High Arbiter's stormstone walls, wondering. I have a whole list of questions I wondered. They don't matter now. There are never good answers to those questions, my lord. Never.'\\n Gardus winced. 'Life can be cruel.'\\n Pain glistened in Omat's eyes. 'It keeps the things we want just out of reach, does it not?' She placed her hands in her apron. 'It's difficult, lord, surely. To consider one of yours might have done this. But surely not impossible? They say you're human, deep down. Humans are not perfect.'\\n Gardus opened the hatch leading into the caverns of Claw's Eye, relishing the cool kiss of damp air. 'No,' he agreed. 'We are not.'\\n The Stormcasts least of all.\\n\",\n",
       " \"Live, die, live again. War without end.\\n These were Sigmar's promises to the faithful, those who live with fight in their veins and a prayer on their lips. The Stormcast Eternals wore the souls of those men and women, stolen from life and death, forged into the finest warriors the realms had ever known.\\n But they were not perfect. Not without flaws.\\n To be Reforged was to have one's soul ripped from its mortal shell. To be plucked from the tempest of battle or the oceans of death by the ruthless hands of a stern god, and then to suffer the wrath of his creation.\\n Gardus had been worked twice upon the Anvil of Apotheosis. It was not a kind experience. Hammered with such power, the soul fractured before it tempered. Through those fissures dripped away the memories which once welded his mortal life together. That splendid pearl of humanity sloughed away from the Reforged soul like slag in an iron smelter.\\n Steel remained, yes. Unyieldingness, constancy, just what the God-King demanded from all his warriors. Gardus was more than Garridan could have ever been.\\n But in many ways, he was also less. Only fragments of that marvellous human who preceded Gardus remained. Disjointed flashes of Skinstealers' skulls buckling beneath the punch of his candlesticks, and the pain of death and regret of failure. The moment of his fall, when everything went red, then black – then blistering, blazing white.\\n Even in battle the Stormcasts were far from perfect. Their banners, heavy with victory streamers from wars of glory, had also known defeat. When the warriors fell again, their souls returned to be forged anew. They met that same soul-baring heat, endured that same crushing onus of power. And with each fall, strips of priceless humanity were whittled away from their souls like blades sharpened ever thinner.\\n The process was imperfect. It ever had been, and the Stormcasts knew this. There were parts of Gardus which were gone, and to grasp for those scraps was like chasing tears in a storm.\\n The Hallowed Knights were well regarded among Sigmar's faithful, but Gardus had heard talk of troubled souls populating other Stormhosts. Poorly tempered minds, perhaps fragile by their very nature, or, for all Gardus knew, wittingly forged to be cruel. The Anvils of the Heldenhammer revelled in death, in the final act. The ruthless Knights Excelsior left no trace of corruption in their wake, purging even the faithful if they were touched by the dark powers' corroding taint. The Astral Templars, famed heroes and monster slayers though they were, went to questionable extremes in the prosecution of their wars.\\n Mortals always died in Sigmar's never-ending crusade. That was the way of things. Yet how many of these unwilling saints and martyrs had fallen to the hammers of Sigmar's own Stormcasts Gardus couldn't fathom. Truthfully, until now he hadn't overmuch considered the matter.\\n Gardus hadn't committed himself to Omat's terrible proposition yet. Some feeble human pride within him resisted the possibility. He was loath to even engage the idea that a Hallowed Knight – one of his own Steel Souls, no less – was capable of such evil. They were piety manifest, and Sigmar had always taken up the shield for the weak, not preyed on them.\\n But vexing as Omat's accusation was, it could not be dismissed. Whoever was murdering the mortals would strike again, and the Steel Souls' mandate was clear.\\n Gardus must learn the truth. He must protect Sigmar's faithful in the Mortal Realms, from whoever dared strike them, lest their faith in the God-King and his chosen be forever fractured.\\n Even if it meant questioning his own Stormcasts.\\n Feros received the tidings quietly. The stiff bristles of his beard still dripped from the washing Gardus had interrupted after he had summoned the Retributor-Prime to Claw's Eye's Sigmarite shrine.\\n\",\n",
       " \"The shrine was tiny by any standard: a thimble of space, enough for a few dozen, anchored onto the prominence jutting over the caverns beneath the hill fort. Frankly, Gardus would have sought the counsel of many others before approaching the Retributor-Prime. But the Steel Souls had not come to Ghur at full chamber strength, and among those present, Gardus most trusted the voice of the Heavy Hand.\\n The quiet between the two was thick enough to choke. Flames guttered in sconces on the wall. The ever-stern gaze of their statuesque god witnessed their meeting. This idol was unusual, resembling an orruk. The oral tales of the Claw's Eye clans seem to have confused a few matters from the Age of Myth.\\n 'I do not believe the healer, my lord.' Feros' namesake hands brushed the cliff of his face. Even without his weighty armour, he was massive. 'This could not be the work of a Stormcast Eternal.'\\n That was a relief to hear, even if Gardus was unsure whether he agreed. 'Without investigating her claims, we have no way of knowing for certain. We are not perfect.'\\n 'You speak of Reforging, lord. Of the flaws.' Feros huffed. 'And this means, what? We are capable of any depravity?'\\n 'Were the question merely placed before me, I would turn it away unanswered. But the healer's evidence is disconcerting. I have seen the latest victim, Feros. Something strange is at work.' Gardus paused. 'The mudfields of Gandy,' he said, 'where she found us. Do you remember the fallen civilians?'\\n Feros hardened. 'Don't tell me she blames us, my lord? The orruks are savages, and their caravan was unguarded. And there were no talismans found on those bodies. None.'\\n Gardus met Feros' iron eyes. 'Omat suggested the battle concluded too quickly for the killer to finish…' Gardus hesitated, for he didn't even know the word to use. 'To finish their ritual.'\\n Feros almost sneered. 'My lord. This woman speaks balderdash.'\\n 'And yet the wardens of Claw's Eye confirm Omat's tidings of other killings in the region,' Gardus said. 'The refugees there now whisper of this matter. We must face it head-on.'\\n 'Face what, lord?'\\n This, Gardus wanted to confront least of all: the raw possibility Omat's outrageous claim was true.\\n 'There is much we do not know about ourselves,' Gardus said. 'Much which he has not told us. Souls were not meant to be taken apart and reassembled like clocks. If the healer's allegations are true and there is a killer among us, the Sacrosanct Chambers would be grateful for a closer look at them. It could teach us much about Reforging.'\\n Feros' eyes were impassive. 'In death, we prove ourselves worthy of life.'\\n Gardus gritted his teeth. 'The fifth canticle.'\\n 'Yes, my lord. The God-King keeps faith in us. We must keep faith in each other. If you believe the healer's tidings true, then tell me, Lord of the Steel Souls – exactly who amongst your warriors might break faith with Sigmar?'\\n Gardus didn't enjoy the acid crescendo of Feros' tone, but he had not asked him here for flattery. 'I do not think they would see it that way. If Omat's tidings are true, and her suppositions correct, a Stormcast killer's soul would be… cracked. Untempered, possibly by mistake.'\\n 'By mistake?'\\n 'Let us not lie to ourselves about our god, Heavy Hand. Sigmar is not perfect. This killer, in theory… Perhaps they dream of past adversaries and the Beast-Moons call them to vengeance. Or perhaps they believe these slayings serve Sigmar's purpose, like the Knights Excelsior. If Omat is to be trusted, then–'\\n 'How do you know she is to be trusted, my lord?'\\n Gardus folded his arms. 'She could be mistaken. I pray she is. But to merely dismiss her tidings – to risk other mortals' deaths so that our consciences remain unburdened – would be a dereliction of duty. Our mandate is clear.'\\n\",\n",
       " \"A tonic-bitter prospect slinked behind those words. Gardus did not believe the perpetrator could be one of his warriors, not with his head nor his heart, and he was determined to prove Omat wrong and save the Stormcasts' reputation in the region.\\n And perhaps, just a bit, Gardus wanted to dispel the doubt niggling in the back of his mind.\\n The Heavy Hand looked crestfallen. He crouched before the weathered statue of Sigmar, its neanderthal countenance worn smooth by an age. The statue's granite eyes were as stern and knowing as ever, doubtless in a way Gardus envied. How much simpler this matter might be if the Lord of Azyr's judgement crashed down from the heavens like reinforcements. How much easier if only he told Gardus the truth, and what to do.\\n But that was not Sigmar's way. His silence was as meaningful as any words could ever be.\\n Gardus could almost hear the sweating substance of Feros' contemplations. The Retributor-Prime's nature was to attack his enemy head-on, with little in the way of subtlety to slow him. He was a closed fist colliding with the foe. A hammer to strike, an anvil which would not yield.\\n 'I would speak freely, my lord.'\\n Gardus nodded. 'Always.'\\n Feros rose, like a mountain in motion. 'The orruks muster – feral, naked. A heaving horde of them, eager to stamp out what civilisation blossoms in these lands. The Steel Souls serve Sigmar, as always. But now more than ever we must be whole of mind and purpose to achieve victory. We are outnumbered. The Claw's Eye clans and Freeguilds assist us, but they are not Stormcast.'\\n 'I am not oblivious to these considerations.'\\n 'Then imagine what your chamber will say if you accept this healer's absurd claim and pursue this matter in earnest. You will betray a lack of faith in your own men and women. Warriors who have fought beside you for a century, lord, across the realms. All that is worth something. Accuse us, and the others' faith in your leadership will fracture when it is needed most. Our victory against those yawling beasts is far from assured, and we are not responsible for these perversions.'\\n Gardus wondered what it was like, to feel the certainty Feros felt. 'I am sorry, brother,' he said. 'We owe this to the mortals. I will not let these rumours run rampant uninvestigated.'\\n Feros tensed, some impending massacre lurking beneath the hulk of him. 'Mortals die every day, my lord. At least out there we can do something about it. Do this, and…' He gritted his jaw. 'And the chamber will fracture. I guarantee it.'\\n A horn sounded. An alarm, a call to battle.\\n Feros shot Gardus a miserable scowl. 'The orruks.'\\n Gardus snatched up his tempestos hammer, its massive head snapping with aetheric light, and marched to the shrine's sandstone threshold. 'To arms, Heavy Hand. We have nothing more to discuss.'\\n To call them a sea would have been a tired analogy. They did not surge into the fields, nor gush against the hill. They did not roll up the crags like waves, nor drown the wattle-and-daub outskirts like monsoon rains.\\n They were savages, and they came like savages, bleeding across the open ground here, clotting together there, baying mindlessly from slavering maws, swinging weapons cobbled from scrap. First they took the outskirts, then the lower bluffs. There, felled by shot and arrows, they dogpiled upon heaps of their own dead, assaulting the walls wherever their gorilla limbs reached, bellowing with crude delight.\\n The orruk warclans were always the same. They hounded after the biggest fight and hankered for the greatest takedown. It wasn't honour. It was craving. And once they cracked the bones of Claw's Eye they would slurp out the marrow within, if they could.\\n\",\n",
       " \"Gardus and the wardens commanding the walls had laid out a defensive strategy weeks ago. The watch knew their places on the ramparts, in the towers, in the reserves. The Stormcasts reinforced the vulnerable sections. The old fort's redoubts easily covered each other. The orruks, muscling up the crags like homicidal apes, were exposed wherever they clambered.\\n If it came to it, the Steel Souls would sally at the gates. There, the bottleneck, the allure of combat and the Stormcasts' own god-given might would allow them to butcher the orruks at leisure. A breach was unforeseen, the walls were expected to hold.\\n The orruks broke through in minutes.\\n Here, at least, Gardus' duty was clear.\\n Steel Souls clad in splendid war plate stormed to the breach. They cast back the slobbering orruks, walling in the mortals' flanks. Like lodestones, the creatures' slab-jawed faces and scar-stitched hides attracted blessed hammer and crackling blade. Between pulses of combat, drizzle plinked against the Stormcasts, rinsing mud and ichor from silvered sigmarite plate. Then more orruks surged forward and the breach was doused in butchery again and again.\\n The defence was straightforward – a matter of strength and stamina, not strategy – so when the battle line began flagging, at first Gardus did not understand.\\n It was Feros. The Retributors. In battle, the Heavy Hand usually howled with laughter. He would bellow his name, smashing a path from this champion to the next, smiting them one and all. But now his movements were stiff, tired, as if he dragged the chains of the world behind each swing of his hammer. The battle line, so often eager to follow the Heavy Hand's example, pressed in sluggishly, merely enduring rather than excelling. Doubt had blighted Feros' zeal like a sickness. It spread through the ranks wherever he was seen.\\n 'Feros!' Gardus cried, carving closer, his throat blistering, his limbs burning with effort. The Heavy Hand drifted from one press of orruks to the next, stalking with the bitter commitment of a mortal who had seen their own doom. 'Heavy Hand!'\\n In the shattered stoneworks, a masked orruk crested the hill – a shaman, with stylised fangs like uneven rock picks lining the porcine maw of its cracked wooden mask. Wicked, vermilion eyes addled with stupid vigour peered out from the splintered visage, beneath a sputtering halo of green power. The thing danced, mad and joyous, rocking from one burly leg to the other and howling the ugly name of its god.\\n With the haft of his tempestos hammer, Gardus staved in the skull of another orruk. 'Feros!'\\n The Heavy Hand snapped around. 'What?'\\n All around them, the carnage felt muddled, ungovernable, barely hemmed in by Claw's Eye's walls and the battle line. The wet percussion of blades scything into flesh reminded Gardus of the squelch of trudging through mud. Heartened cries and terrified screams filled his ears. Boasts, curses, tears.\\n 'We take the shaman, brother!' Gardus said. 'Together!'\\n But Feros ignored Gardus, returning to his weary butchery.\\n Gardus bared his teeth and closed the distance. He jerked the Retributor-Prime back. The chamber was watching; Gardus meant to censure Feros. Much was expected from those to whom much was given, and Feros was faltering.\\n But when Gardus met Feros' gaze and stared into the stern sigmarite countenance of their God-King, he hesitated. Something was wrong. Something was terribly wrong.\\n Gardus clasped Feros' arm, wrenching him closer. Their war plate clanged like muted bells. 'Why this maudlin mood, Feros? Steel yourself. We kill the shaman, and I have faith we shall win this yet.'\\n Feros yanked free. 'It is good to know you have faith in something, Lord-Celestant.' He pushed forward again, alone.\\n A moment's choler urged Gardus to strike him, but it was only a moment. He swivelled to the Retributors loitering in the chaos, deprived of their Prime's leadership. 'With me!'\\n\",\n",
       " \"Gardus turned, then a monumental blast of green energy toppled him back into the Liberators' battle line.\\n He scrabbled up. Another meteoric fist of sorcerous, viridescent flame buckled the earth. More fists hammered into the walls around the breach, vaporising mortals on the battlements, sundering the world.\\n He glanced up. The Retributors. The brunt of the orruk sorcery had slammed right into them.\\n A flash of lightning snatched one from the realm, then another. The fallen paladins seared from the hilltop into the heavens, dead again, to be entombed in Sigmaron's soul mills until they were remade. In the breach, the masked orruk shaman lurched back and forth, heavy-footed, guffawing madly at the sight of the slaughter.\\n Feros' pall of melancholy was finally torn away from him. He gazed back from the breach to the smoking ground where his battle brothers had lingered and died. His poisonous mood had spawned this, Gardus knew.\\n But that was the fruit of Gardus' doubt.\\n The Lord-Celestant wrenched his eyes to the still-flagging battle line, to the Stormcasts he had fought beside for a century. The spectre of defeat now hounded them. He had doubted them, too. Just like Feros.\\n He doubted all of them.\\n The round door to Omat's lodgings creaked open. The physician peered out. Beneath her just-washed skirts, Gardus had the impression she was scrubbed clean and parchment dry. Everything about her was disciplined and neat.\\n 'My lord,' she said softly. 'I'm told today's victory was worthy of the God-King.' She made the sign of the hammer.\\n Gardus forced a smile. 'Always. May I enter?'\\n Omat paled. 'Now, my lord?'\\n Gardus nodded. 'I seek counsel, healer. This matter with the murders.'\\n She tugged the door open. 'I do hope your stomach's strong, my lord.'\\n Gardus latched the door closed behind him. Inside, a fungal reek assailed his senses, bringing tears to his eyes.\\n On a crooked table beside a painted wall, a dead orruk lay flayed open.\\n The muscle fibres were pinned apart, its entrails unroped and piled like sausage links. Forest glass bottles and baked clay dishes with various samples surrounded the orruk's lolling jaw. Toadstools perched in the beast's scissored-open flesh, gleaming with foetid moisture.\\n Gardus bit down. 'Where did you find this carcass?'\\n 'I assisted the warriors with clearing the dead and burning them,' she said. 'The wardens gave me this as my due.'\\n Gardus glanced at the precise cuts opening the creature like a rucksack. Omat had a steady hand and a strong stomach. 'What is this for?' he asked.\\n 'Research, my lord.' Omat ambled to a stool beside her dissection table and brandished a journal. A universe of illegible scrawl and meticulous anatomical diagrams filled the pages. 'At the Lycaeum I was a generalist. I studied astronomy, astrology, biology, mycology…' She beamed. 'I send what research I can through the realmgates, or back to Excelsis. They repay the favour. Look at this, lord.'\\n Gardus followed. She took a leather-bound book from her sleeping roll – The Hidden Moons of Ulgu: A Treatise on Lunar Phenomena in the Realm of Shadow. Then Gardus looked to the table, to the mushrooms. Medical curiosity swept aside his moment of consternation. Garridan was still down there, somewhere. 'I have never seen anything like this.'\\n Omat followed his gaze. 'The fungus? It is unusual, yes. We always knew the brutes had fungal qualities. I assumed these were related.'\\n 'They are not?'\\n Omat shook her head gently. 'It could be a bloom, from the moisture. Monsoon season, or…' Something flickered in her eyes. 'It could be an omen.'\\n Gardus stared. An inexpressible impetus moved the healer. She was a woman built around a core of… something. Not her vocation, clearly, not like that doctor who once wore Gardus' soul.\\n One way or the other, she reminded Gardus of himself. Of long-lost Garridan, of everything he could have become.\\n\",\n",
       " \"Omat chuckled. 'Science. Sorcery. It's all rather esoteric, lord, isn't it? You say you seek my counsel. Let us see if I have any wisdom for a lord of the Stormcasts.'\\n Gardus nodded. 'You're versed in these murders. Some of the details do not seem to fit. I wanted to query you on them.'\\n Omat ground her teeth. 'The details. You're sure it's not something else, my lord?'\\n Gardus gave a weary laugh. 'These days I am sure of nothing. Pray tell what you have in mind.'\\n 'I watched the battle at dusk from the keep,' Omat said. 'I saw those fists crater the earth, and your warriors return to the heavens. You pulled the others together, until the ferals turned tail to the horizon like little patches of algae drifting downstream.' She placed a gentle hand upon Gardus' arm. 'You don't want to believe one of yours could have done this, lord. They fight for you. They fall for you. You seek anything to prove they didn't.'\\n Gardus regarded her carefully. 'I have never made a habit of lying to myself. Yes, healer. But I wish to be as certain as you are.' As certain as Feros was.\\n Omat watched him with the patience and sympathy of one who has lived out her years and seen everything under the sun. 'You cannot be, lord. Nothing's ever as certain as we wish it to be. The choice laid out before you is close, but it's still clear. You don't see what I see, because no matter what you say, you do not wish to.' She averted her gaze. 'Maybe that's good, my lord. It's good to believe in something, to do anything to make it true.'\\n 'No,' Gardus said. 'This matter taxes me greatly. My duty is to make these troubling decisions.'\\n 'And I think you will, lord. But this isn't so difficult. It's simple.'\\n Gardus was grave. 'This is not simple.'\\n 'Well.' Omat moistened her lips. 'Perhaps, or perhaps not. But either way, I do not think the man charged with keeping faith with his warriors could have ever let it stay as simple as it should be. The answer lies before you, lord. The talismans found on the bodies come from your Stormcasts. They can be found nowhere else.'\\n Gardus recalled the fallen Retributors from the breach. He thought of his Liberators, and all the battles they had won together, and all the battles that would follow. Soon, no matter what he did, the Steel Souls would hear of his doubt. It would haunt them.\\n Perhaps Feros was right. Perhaps a few mortal souls were not worth compromising his brothers' and sisters' faith in his leadership. But in his heart, Gardus knew that was wrong. The mortals must be protected, and their trust in Sigmar must be restored.\\n Sometimes, when Gardus closed his eyes, he could only see the dead. He would do anything for there to be fewer of them.\\n 'In my profession, we have an old saying,' Omat said. 'The simplest answers are the most likely to be true. If you think one of yours did it, they did. Trust your instincts, lord. In the end you have nothing else.'\\n Gardus walked the broken belt of Claw's Eye's walls, surveying the defences as the mortals prepared for the battles ahead. Raindrops tap-danced irresolutely against his armour. The rain was forever, chinkling in the floodplains, padding against the earth, drizzling from here to there and back again, coming and going as it pleased.\\n He glared into the diaphanous darkness, at the glowing pyres of orruk carcasses in the outskirts. Freeguilders buried their fallen. The Claw's Eye clans collected theirs but left the sigmarite talismans for the Ghurish earth. With the mystery of the recent killings unsolved, the seed of doubt in Sigmar and his chosen had been sown in Claw's Eye. What would grow from it, Gardus did not want to know.\\n Inside, more refugees flooded Claw's Eye's innards. The hill fort's defence was as imperative as it had ever been. So was discovering the truth about the murders.\\n Omat was so certain she had the answers. Feros, too.\\n Gardus was certain of nothing.\\n\",\n",
       " \"True faith didn't exist in a vacuum – that was the dogma of cruel war priests and masochistic flagellants. Blind belief was poison. The Hallowed Knights' faith in Sigmar was not an immovable rock but a river flowing in constant renewal. Not a hill to die upon but a banner to be defended, flown where it was needed most, even stowed if the circumstances so demanded.\\n But that was faith in Sigmar. Never before had Gardus considered his faith in his chamber and their faith in him, that was always presupposed. Reforging, for all its flaws, was also considered a passed trial. The Stormcasts had Sigmar's blessing. Their trust in each other was never meant to be questioned, only taken for granted. In an age of war, such confidence in one's brethren was the burning substance of triumph.\\n Now, Gardus' faith in his warriors was rattled and fragile, like a temple's settling foundations after an earthquake. And theirs in him, too.\\n How could he repair that trust? Where did he even start?\\n Pausing on the battlements, Gardus sensed something. Light within, pressing its way to his flesh: a ripeness eager to burst.\\n This feeling was not new. Starlight shone in Gardus like a captive sun in the void of who he had once been. Sometimes he felt like an old ship, restored plank by plank, freshly tarred with a just-woven sail. Beautiful, new, in the way things touched by divinity are, but utterly distinct from whatever preceded him, no matter how similar he appeared.\\n Much was expected from those to whom much was given, Gardus knew. But never before had he felt so unworthy of his power – his burden. Never before had the captured starlight shining within him so little resembled grace.\\n Reforging. That was the problem. Gardus' doubt in Reforging was his doubt in everything. In Sigmar, in himself, in his warriors. He had always trusted the process before. With Omat's tidings, that faith had fractured. Unabated, this blight could persist far into future wars and campaigns. The Steel Souls could not truly die, and so they would never forget. Neither would Gardus.\\n This is not the enemy I was meant to fight, he thought.\\n But here, Gardus himself was his own, sole enemy.\\n A cirrus veil blocked the light of the stars. When the monsoon season ended, the twinkling aether would wash away the overcast weather. Ghur's Beast-Moons and feast-honoured constellations would return. The realm would shift, and then would come the ever-constant light of Hysh, the sun of all worlds. Of these things at least, Gardus was certain.\\n That was the beauty of faith. Test it, try it. Suffocate it for a time if need be. The light would pierce the clouds before the end, just as always, and Gardus' belief would only be stronger.\\n He knew what he must do.\\n 'I have tarried. And for that I pray your forgiveness.'\\n In Claw's Eye's shrine the assembled Steel Souls stood shoulder to shoulder before Gardus, motionless under the beastly countenance of their God-King.\\n 'Our brotherhood and faith in Sigmar have always bound us,' Gardus said. 'Yet there are times when my duty requires decisions with which I would never burden any of you. Come forward, Feros of the Heavy Hand.'\\n The others parted to make way. Feros lowered his hammer to the stone with a sonorous thud. 'My lord.'\\n 'Remove your helm.'\\n Beneath the fortress of his armour, Feros hesitated. Then he slid his helm free. His face was the picture of grief, his lips a tense cut in his bearded jaw. Feros had lost his Retributors today. Brothers, sisters. Gardus would not let him lose anything else.\\n 'I know of what you whisper to the others.' Gardus' tone held no rage, for he was not angry. No spite, for he resented nothing. Where doubt once clung, resolve now blazed. 'Tell me what you told them.'\\n 'Of the murders, my lord.' Feros' bass growl bordered on insubordinate, but it was only the sound of faith shaken. 'I told them of your suspicions. Your plan to investigate our chamber, to prove our innocence to the mortals.'\\n\",\n",
       " \"The words rippled through the Stormcasts. Helmets clinked against breastplates as heads were lowered in ignominy.\\n The time had come to settle this. Gardus brandished the hammer of his gaze at his immortals. 'Who among you believes us incapable of such evil? Who among you – knowing what you know, having endured what you have endured – believes us above all fault?'\\n The slash and tear of guttering flames in the wall sconces filled the thick air.\\n Gardus turned to Feros. 'Did you think I would not question my own chamber, with signs as certain as these? Do you think I would not question our honour, to protect the mortals?'\\n Feros peered down. Shame burdened him like a mantle.\\n 'For a century we have battled side by side across the Mortal Realms,' said Gardus. 'We protect Sigmar's faithful wherever we tread. We lay low his enemies and purge darkness from the corners of the world. Not once have I ever truly questioned you, and not once will I ever. I believe in all of you. My trust in this chamber is complete.'\\n A pulse of hammers on stone electrified the air. The Steel Souls murmured, heartened.\\n Feros fought back a smile. 'Yes, my lord.'\\n Gardus' gaze softened. 'Feros, brother. If my hesitation raised your own doubts in me, forgive me. I am not perfect, and I see this now. Yet we are Hallowed Knights. Without such moments of doubt, what would our faith mean?' Gardus extended his arm.\\n Feros, grinning, clasped it.\\n Omat sauntered through the shrine's threshold, and the Steel Souls' hammers ceased their chant on the stone.\\n Gardus' gaze fell upon her. Omat had thought no one would see her for what she was. She had almost been right.\\n The healer wavered. 'I was summoned. By…'\\n Gardus was reminded of a worm squirming in mud, its stone upturned. 'Steel Souls, behold. The killer I seek.'\\n Liberators drew to Omat's flanks.\\n 'I-I didn't kill anybody!' she stammered.\\n Gardus approached, his heels thudding ponderously against the stone. 'The Steel Souls were not the only ones present in each place where innocents were slain. You were there, too. With the sigmarite talismans you took from the dead after each of our battles – the talismans you used to frame us. Nobody questioned you, and I saw so much of myself in you, I didn't stop to think. But you said it yourself, Omat. The simplest answer is most likely to be true.'\\n Omat licked her lips. 'I was helping, lord. I told you.'\\n 'No. You were caught by Claw's Eye's watch, and you crafted these lies to save yourself.'\\n Omat stammered something else, but it was pointless. Gardus trusted his instincts. She could say a thousand things – a thousand silver-tongued, polished alibis, and each one he'd scrape away as deceit until only the wriggling creature of her utter falsehood remained.\\n Feros tramped forward. 'The Ghur-daughter lies. Uther, Q'umon – seize her.'\\n Omat bolted outside. Two Liberators thundered after her, then recoiled at a sheen of sickly light glowing in the threshold.\\n Gardus followed. Outside, an awful lustre oozed from the night sky. Ill, ghastly green, the shade of absinthe and wormwood and the manic mind.\\n Gardus raised his eyes and saw the source of the glow. He regretted ever looking.\\n There, like an ulcer in the firmament – a gurning moon.\\n Never had Gardus seen such a hideous visage. The moon's eyes were uneven saucers, bent and sleepless, girded with mountainous bags and fissured with canyon veins of green. A sick rictus carved open the hemisphere of the moon's jaw – for this moon had jaws and a wrecking-ball smile – better suited to some raving grot fanatic gyrating across a battlefield than a sacred celestial body.\\n But this moon was not sacred, only mad, and when Gardus blinked, it swelled closer, leering. This was no Beast-Moon. This was a wicked moon, a freak of un-sanity, un-sense, un-reason. A hateful, deranged, spiteful moon, with evil thoughts and evil needs.\\n A Bad Moon – as bad as they came.\\n\",\n",
       " \"Rompalicious, gambolific lunacy scratched at the bastion of Gardus' will. The Bad Moon urged him to cavort down into Claw's Eye's caves, to wrench mortals apart by their fingers and toes. A narcotic hunger for violence frisked through him, an impulse, like an invasive spore from the ribs of fungus now rupturing from the hill fort's bedrock, punching out from within the stone of its walls.\\n The madness sought purchase in Gardus, too, to sink its raving rot into the crannies of his mind.\\n But Gardus was blessed by the stuff of Sigmar, and to this madness the Stormcast Eternals could not succumb. He had doubted. Now he knew. Mortals might be vulnerable to such sick magicks, but not the Steel Souls.\\n Omat spasmed, worshipping the death of reason in the sky.'So long!' she bleated. 'I killed in Aqshy, calling you… I killed in Ghyran, calling you… In all the realms… Cutting… Slicing… Ripping… Chopping! Pretending I was like them. Pretending I didn't know you! But you're back! Back, at last! Back, to me!'\\n Gardus recalled Omat's story. She had survived an atrocity, out collecting mushrooms as a girl, with her brother.\\n This is what she saw that night – the Bad Moon. In all the time since, she had sought its return. Lunacy was her reward…\\n And death.\\n Omat's washed and wrinkleless skin folded, creased, bulged. Ugly toadstools punched their fat fingertips through her mottling flesh. The shell of her skull cracked. Mushrooms peeked from jiggling brain tissue through wisps of greying hair. Her bleating tantrum sloughed apart into meaningless syllables. Her tongue exploded in a spore-ridden mess. Stems of scowling fungi pushed her open until she came apart with a slobbering squelch.\\n Inside Claw's Eye, in the caverns below, there came shrieks and cackles. Shadows beneath the shrine crawled with the movement of grots and their monstrous pets. Refugees scurried upward, screaming in fear, to the Stormcasts and Sigmar's shrine. The creatures capered after them, sharp-eared and dagger-nosed, wicked iron blades gripped between their razor-nail fingers. The caves below ran deep; they must have connected to the grots' dank lairs.\\n 'More on the walls,' Feros said. Gardus spied them – grots pouring through the breach, spiders heaving over the battlements. The touch of moonlight killed many among the defences, petrifying watchmen into mushrooms, bursting soldiers in sickening, anticlimactic puffs of spores.\\n They were everywhere. Toothy squigs. Rambling grots with rusty scrap weapons. They came from the walls, from the caverns, up the stoneways, towards the shrine. Larger monsters pounded in the darkness, and then troggoths lumbered out into the Bad Moon's glow.\\n Innocents fled through a gap in the just-formed Stormcasts' line, packing into the shrine. Gardus caught sight of the weeping woman from the mule-pulled cart that morning in the mudfields of Gandy. She stole past with her children, frantic.\\n Feros slammed the haft of his lightning hammer into his open palm. 'Grots and orruks until my death. Another stinking horde of them. Some of us may not survive the night, my lord.'\\n 'No.' A smile warmed Gardus' lips. 'Only the faithful.'\\n Feros laughed, then bellowed, 'Forward, insects! To me! To the Heavy Hand! I will give you the end you crave!'\\n Grots surrounded the Steel Souls, closing in from above and below.\\n The Stormcasts were outnumbered. Surrounded.\\n At last. The war they were forged for.\\n\"]"

       "'\\n#MURDER BY MOONLIGHT\\n\\n\\nStanding in sopping fields of stinking mud, Lord-Celestant Gardus of the Steel Souls drove a nagging worry from his mind.\\n\\nNot fear. Never fear. This was more tedious. Disquiet: incessant, parasitic, gnawing. It rasped at the shield of his patience, clawing at the armour of his calm, urging him to harken.\\n\\nThis is not the war you were forged for. And this is not the battle you sought.\\n\\nGardus returned his attention to the mortals, who had almost finished their ministrations to the dead. Rows of fallen comrades surrounded them. Islands of naked orruk corpses dotted the flooded killing fields. The hungry silt bed pulled at them in sedate pulses, drawing the slain down towards the shale maws said to feast below. Ghur hungered, always.\\n\\nHeavy boot-falls thudded closer. Retributor-Prime Feros of the Heavy Hand slogged to Gardus’ side. Feros was a formidable tower of plate and muscle, as steady as the Stormcasts came.\\n\\n‘Grey skies, grey lands, grey souls. And rain without end.’ Feros shouldered his hammer, and its head spat with the play of mist on lightning. ‘I am grateful to serve the God-King, Lord-Celestant, but this is not a war I would have asked for.’\\n\\nGardus suppressed a grim smile beneath his stern-faced mask. The Heavy Hand’s protestations were like an old blanket, welcome and warm in these cold lands. ‘Take pride, Feros. We bring faith and salvation to the Claw’s Eye clans. We have endured far worse than this.’\\n\\n‘Aye, what I’d do for worse.’ Savage nostalgia underpinned Feros’ bass growl. ‘Ghyran, lord. Or Gravewild. Those were battles of renown.’\\n\\nTogether they watched the Freeguild guardsmen and Claw’s Eye warriors finish their tallies of the dead. The guardsmen placed sigmarite talismans upon the fallen, reminders of the cause they served, and which served them.\\n\\nThe talismans were gift from the Steel Souls. Gardus’ chamber had come here not merely to protect the Claw’s Eye clans, but also to return them to the fold of Sigmar’s worship. The Reclaimed must be made to understand that Sigmar would protect them. He would not have sent Stormcasts otherwise.\\n\\nThe mortals muttered in their motley tongues, brushing obsessively at their exposed flesh lest an insistent native fungus take root. A mildewed fug blanketed the lands. Mushrooms flowered in the silt beds, on the dead, feeding on whatever would nourish them. The fungus was another realisation of Ghur’s ravenous nature, Gardus suspected. But even the Claw’s Eye clans didn’t know where it came from.\\n\\nA cry echoed across the fields, passing from the road on the ridge to the guardsmen scavenging and prowling in the mud.\\n\\n‘More orruks in the lowlands, I reckon,’ Feros rumbled. ‘They summon the lord of the Stormcasts.’\\n\\nGardus straightened, moving with the inevitability of an iceberg adrift. ‘No. This is something else.’\\n\\nA mule-pulled cart trundled closer. From Excelsis, judging by the tack. Beside it, a daughter of Ghur shouted at dog-tired guardsmen and sinewy clansmen in baggy trousers. The soldiery tried to calm her, but that only caused the woman to raise her voice. She demanded to see him.\\n\\nIntrigued, he made his way to the ridge. Something about the Ghur-daughter felt familiar. Not her clean, threadbare dress, nor her hair the shade of straw from Azyrite blood. Nor indeed her fairness, which belied obvious strength. She looked like she could have pulled the cart she came with faster than its mules.\\n\\nThe straw-haired Ghur-daughter dug a kerchief into her wrinkleless hands, brushing the crevices of her nails before meeting Gardus’ gaze. Her eyes were bluff but sincere. ‘Lord of the Stormcasts?’\\n\\n‘I am Lord-Celestant Gardus, of the Steel Souls.’ He glanced to her kerchief, to the smears of blood bronzed from exposure. A leather roll of surgeon’s instruments was slung over her shoulder.\\n\\nShe was a physician. Perhaps an army surgeon with one of the Freeguilds, but certainly a healer.\\n\\nAnother bout of fickle rain sighed across the battlefield. Gardus glanced into the cart, at another woman with two armfuls of children, all of them weeping.\\n\\nThe doctor within Gardus – Garridan of Demesnus, that fallen hero of a bygone age, plucked from death’s clutches by the God-King himself – sensed something deeply wrong.\\n\\nHe unclasped his helm and knelt, letting the road’s filth seep into his finely worked greaves. Better the mortals see the human rather than the hero. A goliath, with an unshorn mane of ivory-white hair and starlight in the depths of him. But nevertheless human. Nevertheless kind.\\n\\n‘You are troubled,’ Gardus told the mourners. He held out a talisman, one of those his chamber distributed to the local warriors. ‘Take heart. Sigmar protects his faithful. We are here for you.’\\n\\nTerror stricken, the woman in the cart recoiled. Her children grew inconsolable. They clasped at their mother, drawing away from Gardus.\\n\\n‘The man of their house was murdered, my lord,’ the straw-haired healer said. ‘In Claw’s Eye, after eventide, under the light of the Beast-Moons.’\\n\\nGardus turned and regarded her. Her tone was hard, sharp, like an old hunting knife slicing its master’s thumb. Purpose filled her poise, but grace did, too.\\n\\nAnd accusation.\\n\\n‘That is regrettable,’ Gardus said sincerely. ‘But it does not concern a Lord-Celestant of the Hallowed Knights.’\\n\\n‘It does, my lord.’ The Ghur-daughter raised her voice for all to hear. She was like a quarrel in flight to its target’s heart. She would not be deterred. ‘Because I believe one of your warriors did it. One of your Stormcast Eternals. And this murder was not their first.’\\n\\nThe healer’s name was Omat. As Gardus predicted, she was a physician from Excelsis, but no army surgeon. Omat wandered the realm tending to Sigmar’s faithful. Like the Steel Souls, she had come to this part of Ghur to bring faith to the Reclaimed of Claw’s Eye. She had a scholar’s polish and a mother’s drive.\\n\\n‘These killings have haunted the region since I’ve been here,’ she said on the road back to the keep. Her manner was kind but direct, and something about her reminded Gardus of well-washed hands. ‘I’ve seen the victims myself, lord. Before the settlers and clansmen sought refuge in Claw’s Eye. Of this latest killing in the caves, I learned just before the watch came. It was only by the grace of Sigmar I was there to tell them.’\\n\\n‘Tell them what?’ Gardus asked.\\n\\nOmat’s eyes glimmered. She was old beyond her years. Empathetic. But Gardus knew better than most that empathy was a twice-cutting blade.\\n\\n‘These murders occur where your warriors pass, my lord,’ Omat said. ‘This cannot be a coincidence. And I have proof it is not.’\\n\\nSoon, the silhouette of a rural castle jutted into the marble skies. Claw’s Eye, a hill fort raised by some forgotten kingdom, then squatted in by their forever-diminishing successors, before finally Ghurish clans and a slew of Excelsis’ crusaders colonised and restored the keep.\\n\\nFrom without, Claw’s Eye appeared like any other minor castle town. A keep sitting on a prominence of bone-hard bedrock behind a weatherworn sandstone bailey, reinforced by limestone and timber. Wattle-and-daub buildings studded the foot of the crags below, a village of somnolent craftsmen and suffocating prosperity.\\n\\nBehind the gates of Claw’s Eye lay the secret of it – a labyrinth of old caverns, carved deep below the crust of Ghur. Ragged stone viaducts criss-crossed a gaping chasm, connecting hewn cliff faces of tiered stone galleries, each lined with chambers, oubliettes, tunnels and stubborn gloom.\\n\\nNone had explored the full depths of the caverns, but that expansiveness had proved a blessing. Refugees had fled to Claw’s Eye en masse ever since the orruk warclans rallied and the Stormcasts lanced down from the sky to cull them. The dispossessed now filled the cave passages. They spilled from their meagre apartments into the winding streets, their belongings heaped up on corners and nooks, wherever the castle wardens tolerated them. Only the Temple of Sigmar, cantilevered over the yawning hollow like a madman’s gamble, remained untouched by refugees.\\n\\nOmat led Gardus into the labyrinth below, to an unremarkable chamber. Encased in bulky war plate, the Lord-Celestant didn’t fit in the cramped hovel so much as stuff it. He ducked below chipped crockery dangling from uneven slats and sidled past woven-reed baskets hanging from bent nails. How a family had called this home, he wasn’t sure.\\n\\nOmat eased up to a table bearing a human-shaped roll of burlap.\\n\\n‘The victim?’ Gardus asked.\\n\\nOmat nodded.\\n\\nGardus frowned. Some part of him had hoped Omat had been mistaken. The Steel Souls were supposed to bring salvation to the troubled sanctuary of Claw’s Eye. Not this.\\n\\nThen again, Omat hadn’t divulged the whole story. She hadn’t even provided proof of her claims.\\n\\n‘Explain what you’ve found,’ Gardus said. ‘Leave nothing out.’\\n\\nOmat crept around the table, tucking her bloodstained kerchief into the waist of her skirts. ‘I’ve spent my years wandering, my lord. I attend to those I can, often too late to be of any use, save to determine cause of death.’ She made the sign of the hammer. ‘Usually, I deal with fallen brutes in tavern brawls, or the sick and the frail. But lately, innocents like these. Take a look.’\\n\\nShe threw back the burlap, and Gardus leaned in.\\n\\nThe victim, poor soul, had hardly reached manhood. His unblemished skin was as grey as the monsoon horizon. A deep incision laid his throat open like a canyon. The bloodless gash glared up at Gardus like a wretched smile.\\n\\nGardus grimaced. ‘This occurred under the Beast-Moons?’\\n\\n‘Yes, at their zenith.’\\n\\nThat could not be coincidence. ‘Is that uncommon?’\\n\\nOmat shook her head, brushing strands of hair behind her ear. ‘“The Wolf’s Glare”, the clansmen call it. It occurs every seventeen days, like clockwork.’\\n\\nGardus stared. If a Stormcast was indeed responsible for this, the matter must be addressed delicately.\\n\\nIf.\\n\\n‘You’ve inspected the other victims?’ he asked.\\n\\nOmat nodded.\\n\\n‘And timing aside, what proof do you have one of Sigmar’s chosen is committing these heinous acts?’ Nothing about the slash in the boy’s throat reminded Gardus of a runeblade’s edge. The cut was too clean. The boy’s head was still on his shoulders.\\n\\nOmat hesitated. ‘That talisman you offered the woman and her children, my lord. I’ve seen them around this region. Warhammers, cast in alloyed sigmarite.’ She sized them out with her hands. ‘Tiny, rough-shaped. Tokens of the God-King’s vigilance, yes?’\\n\\n‘We are warriors, Omat,’ Gardus said. ‘And many things besides. Our mission here is not only one of war. We offer the Claw’s Eye clans the sanctuary which faith provides. Faith in the God-King’s purpose, his works.’\\n\\nOmat lowered a gentle hand to the burlap and tugged the scrim back.\\n\\nResting on the man’s belly, between his clasped fingers, was one of the very talismans Omat and Gardus spoke of. It was burnished and bright, save for the unsettling blemish of hardened blood.\\n\\n‘Anybody could have left that,’ Gardus said.\\n\\nOmat narrowed her eyes, trenchant and brave. ‘And tell me, my lord, who else would have left it? The orruks? Or the fallen who inherit these tokens?’\\n\\n‘Why would a Stormcast have left this?’ Gardus asked.\\n\\nOmat inhaled deeply. ‘I believe it’s like a signet, lord. Left behind to mark the deed, or bring honour to Sigmar.’ Again, she made the sign of the hammer.\\n\\n‘Wanton killing brings no honour to Sigmar,’ Gardus said. ‘You hail from Excelsis, but we are not Knights Excelsior.’\\n\\n‘I make no claim to know you, my lord. But respectfully, such cues left behind are common after murders like these. And whatever is spoken of your kind, you are still human, deep down. And I have heard whispers your soul forging can… change you.’\\n\\nGardus understood Omat’s thrust. ‘Who else knows of this, healer?’\\n\\nOmat darkened. ‘I didn’t mean to–’\\n\\n‘Who else?’ Gardus repeated.\\n\\nOmat’s eyes smoothed. ‘As I said. The watch. And I mentioned the other cases, all with their own talismans…’ She blinked, then met Gardus’ gaze. ‘The whispers are already spreading throughout Claw’s Eye, lord. That Sigmar’s chosen bring not salvation, but death. And to be honest…’\\n\\nGardus leaned back. ‘You believe it, too.’\\n\\n‘It is difficult to get around the timing and the talismans, my lord.’\\n\\n‘And the locations, if this only occurs in settlements we’ve passed through.’ Gardus frowned. ‘How many other cases have you discovered?’\\n\\nShe told him, and he didn’t believe his ears.\\n\\nGardus felt disconsolate. ‘You studied in Excelsis?’\\n\\n‘At the Lycaeum, lord. In the Noble Quarter.’\\n\\nThe Lycaeum of Excelsis was famed for many reasons, and Gardus had heard its name more than once, even as a mortal.\\n\\nOmat was educated and reliable, then. An expert.\\n\\n‘When the watch found me,’ Omat said, ‘I suggested they raise the matter elsewhere. With the Grand Conclave of Excelsis, perhaps. If the killer really was one of yours, I didn’t trust bringing this up with you. But the Claw’s Eye clans and the watchmen, they say you’re a legend. A man of repute, and kindness. Or, if not a man–’\\n\\n‘Please,’ Gardus demurred. ‘I am certainly no god.’\\n\\nShe nodded. ‘I mean to say I trust repute, lord. I trust kindness.’\\n\\nDespite his scepticism, Gardus trusted Omat, too. It was hard not to. Omat somehow reminded him of what he could have been an age ago, if Garridan of Demesnus hadn’t died a hero.\\n\\nBut Garridan was gone. No more than a half-remembered saint in a tumbledown fishing port, a smattering of inconstant flashes from a past bleeding away from him, and the remembered weight of old candlesticks in unfaltering hands.\\n\\nGardus edged away from the table, careful not to scrape his armour along the smoke-stained ceiling. He stared at a brace of fungus hanging in the corner like a huntsman’s trophy antlers. ‘You bring dark tidings, healer,’ he said. ‘Much is at stake in Claw’s Eye. We cannot lose the clans’ trust.’ He peered at the victim. ‘This isn’t right.’\\n\\nOmat replaced the burlap. ‘There’s a host of things not-right in the realms, my lord. This would not be the first of them.’\\n\\n‘You’ve seen your share, I imagine.’\\n\\nGloom poisoned Omat’s countenance. ‘As a child, I went picking mushrooms with my brother one night. Mother kissed us farewell. Father told us to be safe. We fell asleep by the river, then came back before dawn. Our village had been attacked by grots.’ She shivered. ‘I picked up the pieces of them, hoping Sigmar would put them back together again. Like you.’\\n\\nGarridan’s mortal life had ended in such an atrocity. Gardus couldn’t imagine the misery of surviving that. This Ghur-daughter and he were the same, but for a quirk of fate.\\n\\n‘You have my condolences,’ he said. ‘That is a tribulation no mortal should have to endure.’\\n\\nOmat’s lips thinned. ‘Yes. I know, lord. I grew up an orphan in Excelsis, staring at the High Arbiter’s stormstone walls, wondering. I have a whole list of questions I wondered. They don’t matter now. There are never good answers to those questions, my lord. Never.’\\n\\nGardus winced. ‘Life can be cruel.’\\n\\nPain glistened in Omat’s eyes. ‘It keeps the things we want just out of reach, does it not?’ She placed her hands in her apron. ‘It’s difficult, lord, surely. To consider one of yours might have done this. But surely not impossible? They say you’re human, deep down. Humans are not perfect.’\\n\\nGardus opened the hatch leading into the caverns of Claw’s Eye, relishing the cool kiss of damp air. ‘No,’ he agreed. ‘We are not.’\\n\\nThe Stormcasts least of all.\\n\\nLive, die, live again. War without end.\\n\\nThese were Sigmar’s promises to the faithful, those who live with fight in their veins and a prayer on their lips. The Stormcast Eternals wore the souls of those men and women, stolen from life and death, forged into the finest warriors the realms had ever known.\\n\\nBut they were not perfect. Not without flaws.\\n\\nTo be Reforged was to have one’s soul ripped from its mortal shell. To be plucked from the tempest of battle or the oceans of death by the ruthless hands of a stern god, and then to suffer the wrath of his creation.\\n\\nGardus had been worked twice upon the Anvil of Apotheosis. It was not a kind experience. Hammered with such power, the soul fractured before it tempered. Through those fissures dripped away the memories which once welded his mortal life together. That splendid pearl of humanity sloughed away from the Reforged soul like slag in an iron smelter.\\n\\nSteel remained, yes. Unyieldingness, constancy, just what the God-King demanded from all his warriors. Gardus was more than Garridan could have ever been.\\n\\nBut in many ways, he was also less. Only fragments of that marvellous human who preceded Gardus remained. Disjointed flashes of Skinstealers’ skulls buckling beneath the punch of his candlesticks, and the pain of death and regret of failure. The moment of his fall, when everything went red, then black – then blistering, blazing white.\\n\\nEven in battle the Stormcasts were far from perfect. Their banners, heavy with victory streamers from wars of glory, had also known defeat. When the warriors fell again, their souls returned to be forged anew. They met that same soul-baring heat, endured that same crushing onus of power. And with each fall, strips of priceless humanity were whittled away from their souls like blades sharpened ever thinner.\\n\\nThe process was imperfect. It ever had been, and the Stormcasts knew this. There were parts of Gardus which were gone, and to grasp for those scraps was like chasing tears in a storm.\\n\\nThe Hallowed Knights were well regarded among Sigmar’s faithful, but Gardus had heard talk of troubled souls populating other Stormhosts. Poorly tempered minds, perhaps fragile by their very nature, or, for all Gardus knew, wittingly forged to be cruel. The Anvils of the Heldenhammer revelled in death, in the final act. The ruthless Knights Excelsior left no trace of corruption in their wake, purging even the faithful if they were touched by the dark powers’ corroding taint. The Astral Templars, famed heroes and monster slayers though they were, went to questionable extremes in the prosecution of their wars.\\n\\nMortals always died in Sigmar’s never-ending crusade. That was the way of things. Yet how many of these unwilling saints and martyrs had fallen to the hammers of Sigmar’s own Stormcasts Gardus couldn’t fathom. Truthfully, until now he hadn’t overmuch considered the matter.\\n\\nGardus hadn’t committed himself to Omat’s terrible proposition yet. Some feeble human pride within him resisted the possibility. He was loath to even engage the idea that a Hallowed Knight – one of his own Steel Souls, no less – was capable of such evil. They were piety manifest, and Sigmar had always taken up the shield for the weak, not preyed on them.\\n\\nBut vexing as Omat’s accusation was, it could not be dismissed. Whoever was murdering the mortals would strike again, and the Steel Souls’ mandate was clear.\\n\\nGardus must learn the truth. He must protect Sigmar’s faithful in the Mortal Realms, from whoever dared strike them, lest their faith in the God-King and his chosen be forever fractured.\\n\\nEven if it meant questioning his own Stormcasts.\\n\\nFeros received the tidings quietly. The stiff bristles of his beard still dripped from the washing Gardus had interrupted after he had summoned the Retributor-Prime to Claw’s Eye’s Sigmarite shrine.\\n\\nThe shrine was tiny by any standard: a thimble of space, enough for a few dozen, anchored onto the prominence jutting over the caverns beneath the hill fort. Frankly, Gardus would have sought the counsel of many others before approaching the Retributor-Prime. But the Steel Souls had not come to Ghur at full chamber strength, and among those present, Gardus most trusted the voice of the Heavy Hand.\\n\\nThe quiet between the two was thick enough to choke. Flames guttered in sconces on the wall. The ever-stern gaze of their statuesque god witnessed their meeting. This idol was unusual, resembling an orruk. The oral tales of the Claw’s Eye clans seem to have confused a few matters from the Age of Myth.\\n\\n‘I do not believe the healer, my lord.’ Feros’ namesake hands brushed the cliff of his face. Even without his weighty armour, he was massive. ‘This could not be the work of a Stormcast Eternal.’\\n\\nThat was a relief to hear, even if Gardus was unsure whether he agreed. ‘Without investigating her claims, we have no way of knowing for certain. We are not perfect.’\\n\\n‘You speak of Reforging, lord. Of the flaws.’ Feros huffed. ‘And this means, what? We are capable of any depravity?’\\n\\n‘Were the question merely placed before me, I would turn it away unanswered. But the healer’s evidence is disconcerting. I have seen the latest victim, Feros. Something strange is at work.’ Gardus paused. ‘The mudfields of Gandy,’ he said, ‘where she found us. Do you remember the fallen civilians?’\\n\\nFeros hardened. ‘Don’t tell me she blames us, my lord? The orruks are savages, and their caravan was unguarded. And there were no talismans found on those bodies. None.’\\n\\nGardus met Feros’ iron eyes. ‘Omat suggested the battle concluded too quickly for the killer to finish…’ Gardus hesitated, for he didn’t even know the word to use. ‘To finish their ritual.’\\n\\nFeros almost sneered. ‘My lord. This woman speaks balderdash.’\\n\\n‘And yet the wardens of Claw’s Eye confirm Omat’s tidings of other killings in the region,’ Gardus said. ‘The refugees there now whisper of this matter. We must face it head-on.’\\n\\n‘Face what, lord?’\\n\\nThis, Gardus wanted to confront least of all: the raw possibility Omat’s outrageous claim was true.\\n\\n‘There is much we do not know about ourselves,’ Gardus said. ‘Much which he has not told us. Souls were not meant to be taken apart and reassembled like clocks. If the healer’s allegations are true and there is a killer among us, the Sacrosanct Chambers would be grateful for a closer look at them. It could teach us much about Reforging.’\\n\\nFeros’ eyes were impassive. ‘In death, we prove ourselves worthy of life.’\\n\\nGardus gritted his teeth. ‘The fifth canticle.’\\n\\n‘Yes, my lord. The God-King keeps faith in us. We must keep faith in each other. If you believe the healer’s tidings true, then tell me, Lord of the Steel Souls – exactly who amongst your warriors might break faith with Sigmar?’\\n\\nGardus didn’t enjoy the acid crescendo of Feros’ tone, but he had not asked him here for flattery. ‘I do not think they would see it that way. If Omat’s tidings are true, and her suppositions correct, a Stormcast killer’s soul would be… cracked. Untempered, possibly by mistake.’\\n\\n‘By mistake?’\\n\\n‘Let us not lie to ourselves about our god, Heavy Hand. Sigmar is not perfect. This killer, in theory… Perhaps they dream of past adversaries and the Beast-Moons call them to vengeance. Or perhaps they believe these slayings serve Sigmar’s purpose, like the Knights Excelsior. If Omat is to be trusted, then–’\\n\\n‘How do you know she is to be trusted, my lord?’\\n\\nGardus folded his arms. ‘She could be mistaken. I pray she is. But to merely dismiss her tidings – to risk other mortals’ deaths so that our consciences remain unburdened – would be a dereliction of duty. Our mandate is clear.’\\n\\nA tonic-bitter prospect slinked behind those words. Gardus did not believe the perpetrator could be one of his warriors, not with his head nor his heart, and he was determined to prove Omat wrong and save the Stormcasts’ reputation in the region.\\n\\nAnd perhaps, just a bit, Gardus wanted to dispel the doubt niggling in the back of his mind.\\n\\nThe Heavy Hand looked crestfallen. He crouched before the weathered statue of Sigmar, its neanderthal countenance worn smooth by an age. The statue’s granite eyes were as stern and knowing as ever, doubtless in a way Gardus envied. How much simpler this matter might be if the Lord of Azyr’s judgement crashed down from the heavens like reinforcements. How much easier if only he told Gardus the truth, and what to do.\\n\\nBut that was not Sigmar’s way. His silence was as meaningful as any words could ever be.\\n\\nGardus could almost hear the sweating substance of Feros’ contemplations. The Retributor-Prime’s nature was to attack his enemy head-on, with little in the way of subtlety to slow him. He was a closed fist colliding with the foe. A hammer to strike, an anvil which would not yield.\\n\\n‘I would speak freely, my lord.’\\n\\nGardus nodded. ‘Always.’\\n\\nFeros rose, like a mountain in motion. ‘The orruks muster – feral, naked. A heaving horde of them, eager to stamp out what civilisation blossoms in these lands. The Steel Souls serve Sigmar, as always. But now more than ever we must be whole of mind and purpose to achieve victory. We are outnumbered. The Claw’s Eye clans and Freeguilds assist us, but they are not Stormcast.’\\n\\n‘I am not oblivious to these considerations.’\\n\\n‘Then imagine what your chamber will say if you accept this healer’s absurd claim and pursue this matter in earnest. You will betray a lack of faith in your own men and women. Warriors who have fought beside you for a century, lord, across the realms. All that is worth something. Accuse us, and the others’ faith in your leadership will fracture when it is needed most. Our victory against those yawling beasts is far from assured, and we are not responsible for these perversions.’\\n\\nGardus wondered what it was like, to feel the certainty Feros felt. ‘I am sorry, brother,’ he said. ‘We owe this to the mortals. I will not let these rumours run rampant uninvestigated.’\\n\\nFeros tensed, some impending massacre lurking beneath the hulk of him. ‘Mortals die every day, my lord. At least out there we can do something about it. Do this, and…’ He gritted his jaw. ‘And the chamber will fracture. I guarantee it.’\\n\\nA horn sounded. An alarm, a call to battle.\\n\\nFeros shot Gardus a miserable scowl. ‘The orruks.’\\n\\nGardus snatched up his tempestos hammer, its massive head snapping with aetheric light, and marched to the shrine’s sandstone threshold. ‘To arms, Heavy Hand. We have nothing more to discuss.’\\n\\nTo call them a sea would have been a tired analogy. They did not surge into the fields, nor gush against the hill. They did not roll up the crags like waves, nor drown the wattle-and-daub outskirts like monsoon rains.\\n\\nThey were savages, and they came like savages, bleeding across the open ground here, clotting together there, baying mindlessly from slavering maws, swinging weapons cobbled from scrap. First they took the outskirts, then the lower bluffs. There, felled by shot and arrows, they dogpiled upon heaps of their own dead, assaulting the walls wherever their gorilla limbs reached, bellowing with crude delight.\\n\\nThe orruk warclans were always the same. They hounded after the biggest fight and hankered for the greatest takedown. It wasn’t honour. It was craving. And once they cracked the bones of Claw’s Eye they would slurp out the marrow within, if they could.\\n\\nGardus and the wardens commanding the walls had laid out a defensive strategy weeks ago. The watch knew their places on the ramparts, in the towers, in the reserves. The Stormcasts reinforced the vulnerable sections. The old fort’s redoubts easily covered each other. The orruks, muscling up the crags like homicidal apes, were exposed wherever they clambered.\\n\\nIf it came to it, the Steel Souls would sally at the gates. There, the bottleneck, the allure of combat and the Stormcasts’ own god-given might would allow them to butcher the orruks at leisure. A breach was unforeseen, the walls were expected to hold.\\n\\nThe orruks broke through in minutes.\\n\\nHere, at least, Gardus’ duty was clear.\\n\\nSteel Souls clad in splendid war plate stormed to the breach. They cast back the slobbering orruks, walling in the mortals’ flanks. Like lodestones, the creatures’ slab-jawed faces and scar-stitched hides attracted blessed hammer and crackling blade. Between pulses of combat, drizzle plinked against the Stormcasts, rinsing mud and ichor from silvered sigmarite plate. Then more orruks surged forward and the breach was doused in butchery again and again.\\n\\nThe defence was straightforward – a matter of strength and stamina, not strategy – so when the battle line began flagging, at first Gardus did not understand.\\n\\nIt was Feros. The Retributors. In battle, the Heavy Hand usually howled with laughter. He would bellow his name, smashing a path from this champion to the next, smiting them one and all. But now his movements were stiff, tired, as if he dragged the chains of the world behind each swing of his hammer. The battle line, so often eager to follow the Heavy Hand’s example, pressed in sluggishly, merely enduring rather than excelling. Doubt had blighted Feros’ zeal like a sickness. It spread through the ranks wherever he was seen.\\n\\n‘Feros!’ Gardus cried, carving closer, his throat blistering, his limbs burning with effort. The Heavy Hand drifted from one press of orruks to the next, stalking with the bitter commitment of a mortal who had seen their own doom. ‘Heavy Hand!’\\n\\nIn the shattered stoneworks, a masked orruk crested the hill – a shaman, with stylised fangs like uneven rock picks lining the porcine maw of its cracked wooden mask. Wicked, vermilion eyes addled with stupid vigour peered out from the splintered visage, beneath a sputtering halo of green power. The thing danced, mad and joyous, rocking from one burly leg to the other and howling the ugly name of its god.\\n\\nWith the haft of his tempestos hammer, Gardus staved in the skull of another orruk. ‘Feros!’\\n\\nThe Heavy Hand snapped around. ‘What?’\\n\\nAll around them, the carnage felt muddled, ungovernable, barely hemmed in by Claw’s Eye’s walls and the battle line. The wet percussion of blades scything into flesh reminded Gardus of the squelch of trudging through mud. Heartened cries and terrified screams filled his ears. Boasts, curses, tears.\\n\\n‘We take the shaman, brother!’ Gardus said. ‘Together!’\\n\\nBut Feros ignored Gardus, returning to his weary butchery.\\n\\nGardus bared his teeth and closed the distance. He jerked the Retributor-Prime back. The chamber was watching; Gardus meant to censure Feros. Much was expected from those to whom much was given, and Feros was faltering.\\n\\nBut when Gardus met Feros’ gaze and stared into the stern sigmarite countenance of their God-King, he hesitated. Something was wrong. Something was terribly wrong.\\n\\nGardus clasped Feros’ arm, wrenching him closer. Their war plate clanged like muted bells. ‘Why this maudlin mood, Feros? Steel yourself. We kill the shaman, and I have faith we shall win this yet.’\\n\\nFeros yanked free. ‘It is good to know you have faith in something, Lord-Celestant.’ He pushed forward again, alone.\\n\\nA moment’s choler urged Gardus to strike him, but it was only a moment. He swivelled to the Retributors loitering in the chaos, deprived of their Prime’s leadership. ‘With me!’\\n\\nGardus turned, then a monumental blast of green energy toppled him back into the Liberators’ battle line.\\n\\nHe scrabbled up. Another meteoric fist of sorcerous, viridescent flame buckled the earth. More fists hammered into the walls around the breach, vaporising mortals on the battlements, sundering the world.\\n\\nHe glanced up. The Retributors. The brunt of the orruk sorcery had slammed right into them.\\n\\nA flash of lightning snatched one from the realm, then another. The fallen paladins seared from the hilltop into the heavens, dead again, to be entombed in Sigmaron’s soul mills until they were remade. In the breach, the masked orruk shaman lurched back and forth, heavy-footed, guffawing madly at the sight of the slaughter.\\n\\nFeros’ pall of melancholy was finally torn away from him. He gazed back from the breach to the smoking ground where his battle brothers had lingered and died. His poisonous mood had spawned this, Gardus knew.\\n\\nBut that was the fruit of Gardus’ doubt.\\n\\nThe Lord-Celestant wrenched his eyes to the still-flagging battle line, to the Stormcasts he had fought beside for a century. The spectre of defeat now hounded them. He had doubted them, too. Just like Feros.\\n\\nHe doubted all of them.\\n\\nThe round door to Omat’s lodgings creaked open. The physician peered out. Beneath her just-washed skirts, Gardus had the impression she was scrubbed clean and parchment dry. Everything about her was disciplined and neat.\\n\\n‘My lord,’ she said softly. ‘I’m told today’s victory was worthy of the God-King.’ She made the sign of the hammer.\\n\\nGardus forced a smile. ‘Always. May I enter?’\\n\\nOmat paled. ‘Now, my lord?’\\n\\nGardus nodded. ‘I seek counsel, healer. This matter with the murders.’\\n\\nShe tugged the door open. ‘I do hope your stomach’s strong, my lord.’\\n\\nGardus latched the door closed behind him. Inside, a fungal reek assailed his senses, bringing tears to his eyes.\\n\\nOn a crooked table beside a painted wall, a dead orruk lay flayed open.\\n\\nThe muscle fibres were pinned apart, its entrails unroped and piled like sausage links. Forest glass bottles and baked clay dishes with various samples surrounded the orruk’s lolling jaw. Toadstools perched in the beast’s scissored-open flesh, gleaming with foetid moisture.\\n\\nGardus bit down. ‘Where did you find this carcass?’\\n\\n‘I assisted the warriors with clearing the dead and burning them,’ she said. ‘The wardens gave me this as my due.’\\n\\nGardus glanced at the precise cuts opening the creature like a rucksack. Omat had a steady hand and a strong stomach. ‘What is this for?’ he asked.\\n\\n‘Research, my lord.’ Omat ambled to a stool beside her dissection table and brandished a journal. A universe of illegible scrawl and meticulous anatomical diagrams filled the pages. ‘At the Lycaeum I was a generalist. I studied astronomy, astrology, biology, mycology…’ She beamed. ‘I send what research I can through the realmgates, or back to Excelsis. They repay the favour. Look at this, lord.’\\n\\nGardus followed. She took a leather-bound book from her sleeping roll – The Hidden Moons of Ulgu: A Treatise on Lunar Phenomena in the Realm of Shadow. Then Gardus looked to the table, to the mushrooms. Medical curiosity swept aside his moment of consternation. Garridan was still down there, somewhere. ‘I have never seen anything like this.’\\n\\nOmat followed his gaze. ‘The fungus? It is unusual, yes. We always knew the brutes had fungal qualities. I assumed these were related.’\\n\\n‘They are not?’\\n\\nOmat shook her head gently. ‘It could be a bloom, from the moisture. Monsoon season, or…’ Something flickered in her eyes. ‘It could be an omen.’\\n\\nGardus stared. An inexpressible impetus moved the healer. She was a woman built around a core of… something. Not her vocation, clearly, not like that doctor who once wore Gardus’ soul.\\n\\nOne way or the other, she reminded Gardus of himself. Of long-lost Garridan, of everything he could have become.\\n\\nOmat chuckled. ‘Science. Sorcery. It’s all rather esoteric, lord, isn’t it? You say you seek my counsel. Let us see if I have any wisdom for a lord of the Stormcasts.’\\n\\nGardus nodded. ‘You’re versed in these murders. Some of the details do not seem to fit. I wanted to query you on them.’\\n\\nOmat ground her teeth. ‘The details. You’re sure it’s not something else, my lord?’\\n\\nGardus gave a weary laugh. ‘These days I am sure of nothing. Pray tell what you have in mind.’\\n\\n‘I watched the battle at dusk from the keep,’ Omat said. ‘I saw those fists crater the earth, and your warriors return to the heavens. You pulled the others together, until the ferals turned tail to the horizon like little patches of algae drifting downstream.’ She placed a gentle hand upon Gardus’ arm. ‘You don’t want to believe one of yours could have done this, lord. They fight for you. They fall for you. You seek anything to prove they didn’t.’\\n\\nGardus regarded her carefully. ‘I have never made a habit of lying to myself. Yes, healer. But I wish to be as certain as you are.’ As certain as Feros was.\\n\\nOmat watched him with the patience and sympathy of one who has lived out her years and seen everything under the sun. ‘You cannot be, lord. Nothing’s ever as certain as we wish it to be. The choice laid out before you is close, but it’s still clear. You don’t see what I see, because no matter what you say, you do not wish to.’ She averted her gaze. ‘Maybe that’s good, my lord. It’s good to believe in something, to do anything to make it true.’\\n\\n‘No,’ Gardus said. ‘This matter taxes me greatly. My duty is to make these troubling decisions.’\\n\\n‘And I think you will, lord. But this isn’t so difficult. It’s simple.’\\n\\nGardus was grave. ‘This is not simple.’\\n\\n‘Well.’ Omat moistened her lips. ‘Perhaps, or perhaps not. But either way, I do not think the man charged with keeping faith with his warriors could have ever let it stay as simple as it should be. The answer lies before you, lord. The talismans found on the bodies come from your Stormcasts. They can be found nowhere else.’\\n\\nGardus recalled the fallen Retributors from the breach. He thought of his Liberators, and all the battles they had won together, and all the battles that would follow. Soon, no matter what he did, the Steel Souls would hear of his doubt. It would haunt them.\\n\\nPerhaps Feros was right. Perhaps a few mortal souls were not worth compromising his brothers’ and sisters’ faith in his leadership. But in his heart, Gardus knew that was wrong. The mortals must be protected, and their trust in Sigmar must be restored.\\n\\nSometimes, when Gardus closed his eyes, he could only see the dead. He would do anything for there to be fewer of them.\\n\\n‘In my profession, we have an old saying,’ Omat said. ‘The simplest answers are the most likely to be true. If you think one of yours did it, they did. Trust your instincts, lord. In the end you have nothing else.’\\n\\nGardus walked the broken belt of Claw’s Eye’s walls, surveying the defences as the mortals prepared for the battles ahead. Raindrops tap-danced irresolutely against his armour. The rain was forever, chinkling in the floodplains, padding against the earth, drizzling from here to there and back again, coming and going as it pleased.\\n\\nHe glared into the diaphanous darkness, at the glowing pyres of orruk carcasses in the outskirts. Freeguilders buried their fallen. The Claw’s Eye clans collected theirs but left the sigmarite talismans for the Ghurish earth. With the mystery of the recent killings unsolved, the seed of doubt in Sigmar and his chosen had been sown in Claw’s Eye. What would grow from it, Gardus did not want to know.\\n\\nInside, more refugees flooded Claw’s Eye’s innards. The hill fort’s defence was as imperative as it had ever been. So was discovering the truth about the murders.\\n\\nOmat was so certain she had the answers. Feros, too.\\n\\nGardus was certain of nothing.\\n\\nTrue faith didn’t exist in a vacuum – that was the dogma of cruel war priests and masochistic flagellants. Blind belief was poison. The Hallowed Knights’ faith in Sigmar was not an immovable rock but a river flowing in constant renewal. Not a hill to die upon but a banner to be defended, flown where it was needed most, even stowed if the circumstances so demanded.\\n\\nBut that was faith in Sigmar. Never before had Gardus considered his faith in his chamber and their faith in him, that was always presupposed. Reforging, for all its flaws, was also considered a passed trial. The Stormcasts had Sigmar’s blessing. Their trust in each other was never meant to be questioned, only taken for granted. In an age of war, such confidence in one’s brethren was the burning substance of triumph.\\n\\nNow, Gardus’ faith in his warriors was rattled and fragile, like a temple’s settling foundations after an earthquake. And theirs in him, too.\\n\\nHow could he repair that trust? Where did he even start?\\n\\nPausing on the battlements, Gardus sensed something. Light within, pressing its way to his flesh: a ripeness eager to burst.\\n\\nThis feeling was not new. Starlight shone in Gardus like a captive sun in the void of who he had once been. Sometimes he felt like an old ship, restored plank by plank, freshly tarred with a just-woven sail. Beautiful, new, in the way things touched by divinity are, but utterly distinct from whatever preceded him, no matter how similar he appeared.\\n\\nMuch was expected from those to whom much was given, Gardus knew. But never before had he felt so unworthy of his power – his burden. Never before had the captured starlight shining within him so little resembled grace.\\n\\nReforging. That was the problem. Gardus’ doubt in Reforging was his doubt in everything. In Sigmar, in himself, in his warriors. He had always trusted the process before. With Omat’s tidings, that faith had fractured. Unabated, this blight could persist far into future wars and campaigns. The Steel Souls could not truly die, and so they would never forget. Neither would Gardus.\\n\\nThis is not the enemy I was meant to fight, he thought.\\n\\nBut here, Gardus himself was his own, sole enemy.\\n\\nA cirrus veil blocked the light of the stars. When the monsoon season ended, the twinkling aether would wash away the overcast weather. Ghur’s Beast-Moons and feast-honoured constellations would return. The realm would shift, and then would come the ever-constant light of Hysh, the sun of all worlds. Of these things at least, Gardus was certain.\\n\\nThat was the beauty of faith. Test it, try it. Suffocate it for a time if need be. The light would pierce the clouds before the end, just as always, and Gardus’ belief would only be stronger.\\n\\nHe knew what he must do.\\n\\n‘I have tarried. And for that I pray your forgiveness.’\\n\\nIn Claw’s Eye’s shrine the assembled Steel Souls stood shoulder to shoulder before Gardus, motionless under the beastly countenance of their God-King.\\n\\n‘Our brotherhood and faith in Sigmar have always bound us,’ Gardus said. ‘Yet there are times when my duty requires decisions with which I would never burden any of you. Come forward, Feros of the Heavy Hand.’\\n\\nThe others parted to make way. Feros lowered his hammer to the stone with a sonorous thud. ‘My lord.’\\n\\n‘Remove your helm.’\\n\\nBeneath the fortress of his armour, Feros hesitated. Then he slid his helm free. His face was the picture of grief, his lips a tense cut in his bearded jaw. Feros had lost his Retributors today. Brothers, sisters. Gardus would not let him lose anything else.\\n\\n‘I know of what you whisper to the others.’ Gardus’ tone held no rage, for he was not angry. No spite, for he resented nothing. Where doubt once clung, resolve now blazed. ‘Tell me what you told them.’\\n\\n‘Of the murders, my lord.’ Feros’ bass growl bordered on insubordinate, but it was only the sound of faith shaken. ‘I told them of your suspicions. Your plan to investigate our chamber, to prove our innocence to the mortals.’\\n\\nThe words rippled through the Stormcasts. Helmets clinked against breastplates as heads were lowered in ignominy.\\n\\nThe time had come to settle this. Gardus brandished the hammer of his gaze at his immortals. ‘Who among you believes us incapable of such evil? Who among you – knowing what you know, having endured what you have endured – believes us above all fault?’\\n\\nThe slash and tear of guttering flames in the wall sconces filled the thick air.\\n\\nGardus turned to Feros. ‘Did you think I would not question my own chamber, with signs as certain as these? Do you think I would not question our honour, to protect the mortals?’\\n\\nFeros peered down. Shame burdened him like a mantle.\\n\\n‘For a century we have battled side by side across the Mortal Realms,’ said Gardus. ‘We protect Sigmar’s faithful wherever we tread. We lay low his enemies and purge darkness from the corners of the world. Not once have I ever truly questioned you, and not once will I ever. I believe in all of you. My trust in this chamber is complete.’\\n\\nA pulse of hammers on stone electrified the air. The Steel Souls murmured, heartened.\\n\\nFeros fought back a smile. ‘Yes, my lord.’\\n\\nGardus’ gaze softened. ‘Feros, brother. If my hesitation raised your own doubts in me, forgive me. I am not perfect, and I see this now. Yet we are Hallowed Knights. Without such moments of doubt, what would our faith mean?’ Gardus extended his arm.\\n\\nFeros, grinning, clasped it.\\n\\nOmat sauntered through the shrine’s threshold, and the Steel Souls’ hammers ceased their chant on the stone.\\n\\nGardus’ gaze fell upon her. Omat had thought no one would see her for what she was. She had almost been right.\\n\\nThe healer wavered. ‘I was summoned. By…’\\n\\nGardus was reminded of a worm squirming in mud, its stone upturned. ‘Steel Souls, behold. The killer I seek.’\\n\\nLiberators drew to Omat’s flanks.\\n\\n‘I-I didn’t kill anybody!’ she stammered.\\n\\nGardus approached, his heels thudding ponderously against the stone. ‘The Steel Souls were not the only ones present in each place where innocents were slain. You were there, too. With the sigmarite talismans you took from the dead after each of our battles – the talismans you used to frame us. Nobody questioned you, and I saw so much of myself in you, I didn’t stop to think. But you said it yourself, Omat. The simplest answer is most likely to be true.’\\n\\nOmat licked her lips. ‘I was helping, lord. I told you.’\\n\\n‘No. You were caught by Claw’s Eye’s watch, and you crafted these lies to save yourself.’\\n\\nOmat stammered something else, but it was pointless. Gardus trusted his instincts. She could say a thousand things – a thousand silver-tongued, polished alibis, and each one he’d scrape away as deceit until only the wriggling creature of her utter falsehood remained.\\n\\nFeros tramped forward. ‘The Ghur-daughter lies. Uther, Q’umon – seize her.’\\n\\nOmat bolted outside. Two Liberators thundered after her, then recoiled at a sheen of sickly light glowing in the threshold.\\n\\nGardus followed. Outside, an awful lustre oozed from the night sky. Ill, ghastly green, the shade of absinthe and wormwood and the manic mind.\\n\\nGardus raised his eyes and saw the source of the glow. He regretted ever looking.\\n\\nThere, like an ulcer in the firmament – a gurning moon.\\n\\nNever had Gardus seen such a hideous visage. The moon’s eyes were uneven saucers, bent and sleepless, girded with mountainous bags and fissured with canyon veins of green. A sick rictus carved open the hemisphere of the moon’s jaw – for this moon had jaws and a wrecking-ball smile – better suited to some raving grot fanatic gyrating across a battlefield than a sacred celestial body.\\n\\nBut this moon was not sacred, only mad, and when Gardus blinked, it swelled closer, leering. This was no Beast-Moon. This was a wicked moon, a freak of un-sanity, un-sense, un-reason. A hateful, deranged, spiteful moon, with evil thoughts and evil needs.\\n\\nA Bad Moon – as bad as they came.\\n\\nRompalicious, gambolific lunacy scratched at the bastion of Gardus’ will. The Bad Moon urged him to cavort down into Claw’s Eye’s caves, to wrench mortals apart by their fingers and toes. A narcotic hunger for violence frisked through him, an impulse, like an invasive spore from the ribs of fungus now rupturing from the hill fort’s bedrock, punching out from within the stone of its walls.\\n\\nThe madness sought purchase in Gardus, too, to sink its raving rot into the crannies of his mind.\\n\\nBut Gardus was blessed by the stuff of Sigmar, and to this madness the Stormcast Eternals could not succumb. He had doubted. Now he knew. Mortals might be vulnerable to such sick magicks, but not the Steel Souls.\\n\\nOmat spasmed, worshipping the death of reason in the sky.‘So long!’ she bleated. ‘I killed in Aqshy, calling you… I killed in Ghyran, calling you… In all the realms… Cutting… Slicing… Ripping… Chopping! Pretending I was like them. Pretending I didn’t know you! But you’re back! Back, at last! Back, to me!’\\n\\nGardus recalled Omat’s story. She had survived an atrocity, out collecting mushrooms as a girl, with her brother.\\n\\nThis is what she saw that night – the Bad Moon. In all the time since, she had sought its return. Lunacy was her reward…\\n\\nAnd death.\\n\\nOmat’s washed and wrinkleless skin folded, creased, bulged. Ugly toadstools punched their fat fingertips through her mottling flesh. The shell of her skull cracked. Mushrooms peeked from jiggling brain tissue through wisps of greying hair. Her bleating tantrum sloughed apart into meaningless syllables. Her tongue exploded in a spore-ridden mess. Stems of scowling fungi pushed her open until she came apart with a slobbering squelch.\\n\\nInside Claw’s Eye, in the caverns below, there came shrieks and cackles. Shadows beneath the shrine crawled with the movement of grots and their monstrous pets. Refugees scurried upward, screaming in fear, to the Stormcasts and Sigmar’s shrine. The creatures capered after them, sharp-eared and dagger-nosed, wicked iron blades gripped between their razor-nail fingers. The caves below ran deep; they must have connected to the grots’ dank lairs.\\n\\n‘More on the walls,’ Feros said. Gardus spied them – grots pouring through the breach, spiders heaving over the battlements. The touch of moonlight killed many among the defences, petrifying watchmen into mushrooms, bursting soldiers in sickening, anticlimactic puffs of spores.\\n\\nThey were everywhere. Toothy squigs. Rambling grots with rusty scrap weapons. They came from the walls, from the caverns, up the stoneways, towards the shrine. Larger monsters pounded in the darkness, and then troggoths lumbered out into the Bad Moon’s glow.\\n\\nInnocents fled through a gap in the just-formed Stormcasts’ line, packing into the shrine. Gardus caught sight of the weeping woman from the mule-pulled cart that morning in the mudfields of Gandy. She stole past with her children, frantic.\\n\\nFeros slammed the haft of his lightning hammer into his open palm. ‘Grots and orruks until my death. Another stinking horde of them. Some of us may not survive the night, my lord.’\\n\\n‘No.’ A smile warmed Gardus’ lips. ‘Only the faithful.’\\n\\nFeros laughed, then bellowed, ‘Forward, insects! To me! To the Heavy Hand! I will give you the end you crave!’\\n\\nGrots surrounded the Steel Souls, closing in from above and below.\\n\\nThe Stormcasts were outnumbered. Surrounded.\\n\\nAt last. The war they were forged for.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n'"

       "'\\n#MURDER BY MOONLIGHT\\n\\nStanding in sopping fields of stinking mud, Lord-Celestant Gardus of the Steel Souls drove a nagging worry from his mind.\\nNot fear. Never fear. This was more tedious. Disquiet: incessant, parasitic, gnawing. It rasped at the shield of his patience, clawing at the armour of his calm, urging him to harken.\\nThis is not the war you were forged for. And this is not the battle you sought.\\nGardus returned his attention to the mortals, who had almost finished their ministrations to the dead. Rows of fallen comrades surrounded them. Islands of naked orruk corpses dotted the flooded killing fields. The hungry silt bed pulled at them in sedate pulses, drawing the slain down towards the shale maws said to feast below. Ghur hungered, always.\\nHeavy boot-falls thudded closer. Retributor-Prime Feros of the Heavy Hand slogged to Gardus’ side. Feros was a formidable tower of plate and muscle, as steady as the Stormcasts came.\\n‘Grey skies, grey lands, grey souls. And rain without end.’ Feros shouldered his hammer, and its head spat with the play of mist on lightning. ‘I am grateful to serve the God-King, Lord-Celestant, but this is not a war I would have asked for.’\\nGardus suppressed a grim smile beneath his stern-faced mask. The Heavy Hand’s protestations were like an old blanket, welcome and warm in these cold lands. ‘Take pride, Feros. We bring faith and salvation to the Claw’s Eye clans. We have endured far worse than this.’\\n‘Aye, what I’d do for worse.’ Savage nostalgia underpinned Feros’ bass growl. ‘Ghyran, lord. Or Gravewild. Those were battles of renown.’\\nTogether they watched the Freeguild guardsmen and Claw’s Eye warriors finish their tallies of the dead. The guardsmen placed sigmarite talismans upon the fallen, reminders of the cause they served, and which served them.\\nThe talismans were gift from the Steel Souls. Gardus’ chamber had come here not merely to protect the Claw’s Eye clans, but also to return them to the fold of Sigmar’s worship. The Reclaimed must be made to understand that Sigmar would protect them. He would not have sent Stormcasts otherwise.\\nThe mortals muttered in their motley tongues, brushing obsessively at their exposed flesh lest an insistent native fungus take root. A mildewed fug blanketed the lands. Mushrooms flowered in the silt beds, on the dead, feeding on whatever would nourish them. The fungus was another realisation of Ghur’s ravenous nature, Gardus suspected. But even the Claw’s Eye clans didn’t know where it came from.\\nA cry echoed across the fields, passing from the road on the ridge to the guardsmen scavenging and prowling in the mud.\\n‘More orruks in the lowlands, I reckon,’ Feros rumbled. ‘They summon the lord of the Stormcasts.’\\nGardus straightened, moving with the inevitability of an iceberg adrift. ‘No. This is something else.’\\nA mule-pulled cart trundled closer. From Excelsis, judging by the tack. Beside it, a daughter of Ghur shouted at dog-tired guardsmen and sinewy clansmen in baggy trousers. The soldiery tried to calm her, but that only caused the woman to raise her voice. She demanded to see him.\\nIntrigued, he made his way to the ridge. Something about the Ghur-daughter felt familiar. Not her clean, threadbare dress, nor her hair the shade of straw from Azyrite blood. Nor indeed her fairness, which belied obvious strength. She looked like she could have pulled the cart she came with faster than its mules.\\nThe straw-haired Ghur-daughter dug a kerchief into her wrinkleless hands, brushing the crevices of her nails before meeting Gardus’ gaze. Her eyes were bluff but sincere. ‘Lord of the Stormcasts?’\\n‘I am Lord-Celestant Gardus, of the Steel Souls.’ He glanced to her kerchief, to the smears of blood bronzed from exposure. A leather roll of surgeon’s instruments was slung over her shoulder.\\nShe was a physician. Perhaps an army surgeon with one of the Freeguilds, but certainly a healer.\\nAnother bout of fickle rain sighed across the battlefield. Gardus glanced into the cart, at another woman with two armfuls of children, all of them weeping.\\nThe doctor within Gardus – Garridan of Demesnus, that fallen hero of a bygone age, plucked from death’s clutches by the God-King himself – sensed something deeply wrong.\\nHe unclasped his helm and knelt, letting the road’s filth seep into his finely worked greaves. Better the mortals see the human rather than the hero. A goliath, with an unshorn mane of ivory-white hair and starlight in the depths of him. But nevertheless human. Nevertheless kind.\\n‘You are troubled,’ Gardus told the mourners. He held out a talisman, one of those his chamber distributed to the local warriors. ‘Take heart. Sigmar protects his faithful. We are here for you.’\\nTerror stricken, the woman in the cart recoiled. Her children grew inconsolable. They clasped at their mother, drawing away from Gardus.\\n‘The man of their house was murdered, my lord,’ the straw-haired healer said. ‘In Claw’s Eye, after eventide, under the light of the Beast-Moons.’\\nGardus turned and regarded her. Her tone was hard, sharp, like an old hunting knife slicing its master’s thumb. Purpose filled her poise, but grace did, too.\\nAnd accusation.\\n‘That is regrettable,’ Gardus said sincerely. ‘But it does not concern a Lord-Celestant of the Hallowed Knights.’\\n‘It does, my lord.’ The Ghur-daughter raised her voice for all to hear. She was like a quarrel in flight to its target’s heart. She would not be deterred. ‘Because I believe one of your warriors did it. One of your Stormcast Eternals. And this murder was not their first.’\\nThe healer’s name was Omat. As Gardus predicted, she was a physician from Excelsis, but no army surgeon. Omat wandered the realm tending to Sigmar’s faithful. Like the Steel Souls, she had come to this part of Ghur to bring faith to the Reclaimed of Claw’s Eye. She had a scholar’s polish and a mother’s drive.\\n‘These killings have haunted the region since I’ve been here,’ she said on the road back to the keep. Her manner was kind but direct, and something about her reminded Gardus of well-washed hands. ‘I’ve seen the victims myself, lord. Before the settlers and clansmen sought refuge in Claw’s Eye. Of this latest killing in the caves, I learned just before the watch came. It was only by the grace of Sigmar I was there to tell them.’\\n‘Tell them what?’ Gardus asked.\\nOmat’s eyes glimmered. She was old beyond her years. Empathetic. But Gardus knew better than most that empathy was a twice-cutting blade.\\n‘These murders occur where your warriors pass, my lord,’ Omat said. ‘This cannot be a coincidence. And I have proof it is not.’\\nSoon, the silhouette of a rural castle jutted into the marble skies. Claw’s Eye, a hill fort raised by some forgotten kingdom, then squatted in by their forever-diminishing successors, before finally Ghurish clans and a slew of Excelsis’ crusaders colonised and restored the keep.\\nFrom without, Claw’s Eye appeared like any other minor castle town. A keep sitting on a prominence of bone-hard bedrock behind a weatherworn sandstone bailey, reinforced by limestone and timber. Wattle-and-daub buildings studded the foot of the crags below, a village of somnolent craftsmen and suffocating prosperity.\\nBehind the gates of Claw’s Eye lay the secret of it – a labyrinth of old caverns, carved deep below the crust of Ghur. Ragged stone viaducts criss-crossed a gaping chasm, connecting hewn cliff faces of tiered stone galleries, each lined with chambers, oubliettes, tunnels and stubborn gloom.\\nNone had explored the full depths of the caverns, but that expansiveness had proved a blessing. Refugees had fled to Claw’s Eye en masse ever since the orruk warclans rallied and the Stormcasts lanced down from the sky to cull them. The dispossessed now filled the cave passages. They spilled from their meagre apartments into the winding streets, their belongings heaped up on corners and nooks, wherever the castle wardens tolerated them. Only the Temple of Sigmar, cantilevered over the yawning hollow like a madman’s gamble, remained untouched by refugees.\\nOmat led Gardus into the labyrinth below, to an unremarkable chamber. Encased in bulky war plate, the Lord-Celestant didn’t fit in the cramped hovel so much as stuff it. He ducked below chipped crockery dangling from uneven slats and sidled past woven-reed baskets hanging from bent nails. How a family had called this home, he wasn’t sure.\\nOmat eased up to a table bearing a human-shaped roll of burlap.\\n‘The victim?’ Gardus asked.\\nOmat nodded.\\nGardus frowned. Some part of him had hoped Omat had been mistaken. The Steel Souls were supposed to bring salvation to the troubled sanctuary of Claw’s Eye. Not this.\\nThen again, Omat hadn’t divulged the whole story. She hadn’t even provided proof of her claims.\\n‘Explain what you’ve found,’ Gardus said. ‘Leave nothing out.’\\nOmat crept around the table, tucking her bloodstained kerchief into the waist of her skirts. ‘I’ve spent my years wandering, my lord. I attend to those I can, often too late to be of any use, save to determine cause of death.’ She made the sign of the hammer. ‘Usually, I deal with fallen brutes in tavern brawls, or the sick and the frail. But lately, innocents like these. Take a look.’\\nShe threw back the burlap, and Gardus leaned in.\\nThe victim, poor soul, had hardly reached manhood. His unblemished skin was as grey as the monsoon horizon. A deep incision laid his throat open like a canyon. The bloodless gash glared up at Gardus like a wretched smile.\\nGardus grimaced. ‘This occurred under the Beast-Moons?’\\n‘Yes, at their zenith.’\\nThat could not be coincidence. ‘Is that uncommon?’\\nOmat shook her head, brushing strands of hair behind her ear. ‘“The Wolf’s Glare”, the clansmen call it. It occurs every seventeen days, like clockwork.’\\nGardus stared. If a Stormcast was indeed responsible for this, the matter must be addressed delicately.\\nIf.\\n‘You’ve inspected the other victims?’ he asked.\\nOmat nodded.\\n‘And timing aside, what proof do you have one of Sigmar’s chosen is committing these heinous acts?’ Nothing about the slash in the boy’s throat reminded Gardus of a runeblade’s edge. The cut was too clean. The boy’s head was still on his shoulders.\\nOmat hesitated. ‘That talisman you offered the woman and her children, my lord. I’ve seen them around this region. Warhammers, cast in alloyed sigmarite.’ She sized them out with her hands. ‘Tiny, rough-shaped. Tokens of the God-King’s vigilance, yes?’\\n‘We are warriors, Omat,’ Gardus said. ‘And many things besides. Our mission here is not only one of war. We offer the Claw’s Eye clans the sanctuary which faith provides. Faith in the God-King’s purpose, his works.’\\nOmat lowered a gentle hand to the burlap and tugged the scrim back.\\nResting on the man’s belly, between his clasped fingers, was one of the very talismans Omat and Gardus spoke of. It was burnished and bright, save for the unsettling blemish of hardened blood.\\n‘Anybody could have left that,’ Gardus said.\\nOmat narrowed her eyes, trenchant and brave. ‘And tell me, my lord, who else would have left it? The orruks? Or the fallen who inherit these tokens?’\\n‘Why would a Stormcast have left this?’ Gardus asked.\\nOmat inhaled deeply. ‘I believe it’s like a signet, lord. Left behind to mark the deed, or bring honour to Sigmar.’ Again, she made the sign of the hammer.\\n‘Wanton killing brings no honour to Sigmar,’ Gardus said. ‘You hail from Excelsis, but we are not Knights Excelsior.’\\n‘I make no claim to know you, my lord. But respectfully, such cues left behind are common after murders like these. And whatever is spoken of your kind, you are still human, deep down. And I have heard whispers your soul forging can… change you.’\\nGardus understood Omat’s thrust. ‘Who else knows of this, healer?’\\nOmat darkened. ‘I didn’t mean to–’\\n‘Who else?’ Gardus repeated.\\nOmat’s eyes smoothed. ‘As I said. The watch. And I mentioned the other cases, all with their own talismans…’ She blinked, then met Gardus’ gaze. ‘The whispers are already spreading throughout Claw’s Eye, lord. That Sigmar’s chosen bring not salvation, but death. And to be honest…’\\nGardus leaned back. ‘You believe it, too.’\\n‘It is difficult to get around the timing and the talismans, my lord.’\\n‘And the locations, if this only occurs in settlements we’ve passed through.’ Gardus frowned. ‘How many other cases have you discovered?’\\nShe told him, and he didn’t believe his ears.\\nGardus felt disconsolate. ‘You studied in Excelsis?’\\n‘At the Lycaeum, lord. In the Noble Quarter.’\\nThe Lycaeum of Excelsis was famed for many reasons, and Gardus had heard its name more than once, even as a mortal.\\nOmat was educated and reliable, then. An expert.\\n‘When the watch found me,’ Omat said, ‘I suggested they raise the matter elsewhere. With the Grand Conclave of Excelsis, perhaps. If the killer really was one of yours, I didn’t trust bringing this up with you. But the Claw’s Eye clans and the watchmen, they say you’re a legend. A man of repute, and kindness. Or, if not a man–’\\n‘Please,’ Gardus demurred. ‘I am certainly no god.’\\nShe nodded. ‘I mean to say I trust repute, lord. I trust kindness.’\\nDespite his scepticism, Gardus trusted Omat, too. It was hard not to. Omat somehow reminded him of what he could have been an age ago, if Garridan of Demesnus hadn’t died a hero.\\nBut Garridan was gone. No more than a half-remembered saint in a tumbledown fishing port, a smattering of inconstant flashes from a past bleeding away from him, and the remembered weight of old candlesticks in unfaltering hands.\\nGardus edged away from the table, careful not to scrape his armour along the smoke-stained ceiling. He stared at a brace of fungus hanging in the corner like a huntsman’s trophy antlers. ‘You bring dark tidings, healer,’ he said. ‘Much is at stake in Claw’s Eye. We cannot lose the clans’ trust.’ He peered at the victim. ‘This isn’t right.’\\nOmat replaced the burlap. ‘There’s a host of things not-right in the realms, my lord. This would not be the first of them.’\\n‘You’ve seen your share, I imagine.’\\nGloom poisoned Omat’s countenance. ‘As a child, I went picking mushrooms with my brother one night. Mother kissed us farewell. Father told us to be safe. We fell asleep by the river, then came back before dawn. Our village had been attacked by grots.’ She shivered. ‘I picked up the pieces of them, hoping Sigmar would put them back together again. Like you.’\\nGarridan’s mortal life had ended in such an atrocity. Gardus couldn’t imagine the misery of surviving that. This Ghur-daughter and he were the same, but for a quirk of fate.\\n‘You have my condolences,’ he said. ‘That is a tribulation no mortal should have to endure.’\\nOmat’s lips thinned. ‘Yes. I know, lord. I grew up an orphan in Excelsis, staring at the High Arbiter’s stormstone walls, wondering. I have a whole list of questions I wondered. They don’t matter now. There are never good answers to those questions, my lord. Never.’\\nGardus winced. ‘Life can be cruel.’\\nPain glistened in Omat’s eyes. ‘It keeps the things we want just out of reach, does it not?’ She placed her hands in her apron. ‘It’s difficult, lord, surely. To consider one of yours might have done this. But surely not impossible? They say you’re human, deep down. Humans are not perfect.’\\nGardus opened the hatch leading into the caverns of Claw’s Eye, relishing the cool kiss of damp air. ‘No,’ he agreed. ‘We are not.’\\nThe Stormcasts least of all.\\nLive, die, live again. War without end.\\nThese were Sigmar’s promises to the faithful, those who live with fight in their veins and a prayer on their lips. The Stormcast Eternals wore the souls of those men and women, stolen from life and death, forged into the finest warriors the realms had ever known.\\nBut they were not perfect. Not without flaws.\\nTo be Reforged was to have one’s soul ripped from its mortal shell. To be plucked from the tempest of battle or the oceans of death by the ruthless hands of a stern god, and then to suffer the wrath of his creation.\\nGardus had been worked twice upon the Anvil of Apotheosis. It was not a kind experience. Hammered with such power, the soul fractured before it tempered. Through those fissures dripped away the memories which once welded his mortal life together. That splendid pearl of humanity sloughed away from the Reforged soul like slag in an iron smelter.\\nSteel remained, yes. Unyieldingness, constancy, just what the God-King demanded from all his warriors. Gardus was more than Garridan could have ever been.\\nBut in many ways, he was also less. Only fragments of that marvellous human who preceded Gardus remained. Disjointed flashes of Skinstealers’ skulls buckling beneath the punch of his candlesticks, and the pain of death and regret of failure. The moment of his fall, when everything went red, then black – then blistering, blazing white.\\nEven in battle the Stormcasts were far from perfect. Their banners, heavy with victory streamers from wars of glory, had also known defeat. When the warriors fell again, their souls returned to be forged anew. They met that same soul-baring heat, endured that same crushing onus of power. And with each fall, strips of priceless humanity were whittled away from their souls like blades sharpened ever thinner.\\nThe process was imperfect. It ever had been, and the Stormcasts knew this. There were parts of Gardus which were gone, and to grasp for those scraps was like chasing tears in a storm.\\nThe Hallowed Knights were well regarded among Sigmar’s faithful, but Gardus had heard talk of troubled souls populating other Stormhosts. Poorly tempered minds, perhaps fragile by their very nature, or, for all Gardus knew, wittingly forged to be cruel. The Anvils of the Heldenhammer revelled in death, in the final act. The ruthless Knights Excelsior left no trace of corruption in their wake, purging even the faithful if they were touched by the dark powers’ corroding taint. The Astral Templars, famed heroes and monster slayers though they were, went to questionable extremes in the prosecution of their wars.\\nMortals always died in Sigmar’s never-ending crusade. That was the way of things. Yet how many of these unwilling saints and martyrs had fallen to the hammers of Sigmar’s own Stormcasts Gardus couldn’t fathom. Truthfully, until now he hadn’t overmuch considered the matter.\\nGardus hadn’t committed himself to Omat’s terrible proposition yet. Some feeble human pride within him resisted the possibility. He was loath to even engage the idea that a Hallowed Knight – one of his own Steel Souls, no less – was capable of such evil. They were piety manifest, and Sigmar had always taken up the shield for the weak, not preyed on them.\\nBut vexing as Omat’s accusation was, it could not be dismissed. Whoever was murdering the mortals would strike again, and the Steel Souls’ mandate was clear.\\nGardus must learn the truth. He must protect Sigmar’s faithful in the Mortal Realms, from whoever dared strike them, lest their faith in the God-King and his chosen be forever fractured.\\nEven if it meant questioning his own Stormcasts.\\nFeros received the tidings quietly. The stiff bristles of his beard still dripped from the washing Gardus had interrupted after he had summoned the Retributor-Prime to Claw’s Eye’s Sigmarite shrine.\\nThe shrine was tiny by any standard: a thimble of space, enough for a few dozen, anchored onto the prominence jutting over the caverns beneath the hill fort. Frankly, Gardus would have sought the counsel of many others before approaching the Retributor-Prime. But the Steel Souls had not come to Ghur at full chamber strength, and among those present, Gardus most trusted the voice of the Heavy Hand.\\nThe quiet between the two was thick enough to choke. Flames guttered in sconces on the wall. The ever-stern gaze of their statuesque god witnessed their meeting. This idol was unusual, resembling an orruk. The oral tales of the Claw’s Eye clans seem to have confused a few matters from the Age of Myth.\\n‘I do not believe the healer, my lord.’ Feros’ namesake hands brushed the cliff of his face. Even without his weighty armour, he was massive. ‘This could not be the work of a Stormcast Eternal.’\\nThat was a relief to hear, even if Gardus was unsure whether he agreed. ‘Without investigating her claims, we have no way of knowing for certain. We are not perfect.’\\n‘You speak of Reforging, lord. Of the flaws.’ Feros huffed. ‘And this means, what? We are capable of any depravity?’\\n‘Were the question merely placed before me, I would turn it away unanswered. But the healer’s evidence is disconcerting. I have seen the latest victim, Feros. Something strange is at work.’ Gardus paused. ‘The mudfields of Gandy,’ he said, ‘where she found us. Do you remember the fallen civilians?’\\nFeros hardened. ‘Don’t tell me she blames us, my lord? The orruks are savages, and their caravan was unguarded. And there were no talismans found on those bodies. None.’\\nGardus met Feros’ iron eyes. ‘Omat suggested the battle concluded too quickly for the killer to finish…’ Gardus hesitated, for he didn’t even know the word to use. ‘To finish their ritual.’\\nFeros almost sneered. ‘My lord. This woman speaks balderdash.’\\n‘And yet the wardens of Claw’s Eye confirm Omat’s tidings of other killings in the region,’ Gardus said. ‘The refugees there now whisper of this matter. We must face it head-on.’\\n‘Face what, lord?’\\nThis, Gardus wanted to confront least of all: the raw possibility Omat’s outrageous claim was true.\\n‘There is much we do not know about ourselves,’ Gardus said. ‘Much which he has not told us. Souls were not meant to be taken apart and reassembled like clocks. If the healer’s allegations are true and there is a killer among us, the Sacrosanct Chambers would be grateful for a closer look at them. It could teach us much about Reforging.’\\nFeros’ eyes were impassive. ‘In death, we prove ourselves worthy of life.’\\nGardus gritted his teeth. ‘The fifth canticle.’\\n‘Yes, my lord. The God-King keeps faith in us. We must keep faith in each other. If you believe the healer’s tidings true, then tell me, Lord of the Steel Souls – exactly who amongst your warriors might break faith with Sigmar?’\\nGardus didn’t enjoy the acid crescendo of Feros’ tone, but he had not asked him here for flattery. ‘I do not think they would see it that way. If Omat’s tidings are true, and her suppositions correct, a Stormcast killer’s soul would be… cracked. Untempered, possibly by mistake.’\\n‘By mistake?’\\n‘Let us not lie to ourselves about our god, Heavy Hand. Sigmar is not perfect. This killer, in theory… Perhaps they dream of past adversaries and the Beast-Moons call them to vengeance. Or perhaps they believe these slayings serve Sigmar’s purpose, like the Knights Excelsior. If Omat is to be trusted, then–’\\n‘How do you know she is to be trusted, my lord?’\\nGardus folded his arms. ‘She could be mistaken. I pray she is. But to merely dismiss her tidings – to risk other mortals’ deaths so that our consciences remain unburdened – would be a dereliction of duty. Our mandate is clear.’\\nA tonic-bitter prospect slinked behind those words. Gardus did not believe the perpetrator could be one of his warriors, not with his head nor his heart, and he was determined to prove Omat wrong and save the Stormcasts’ reputation in the region.\\nAnd perhaps, just a bit, Gardus wanted to dispel the doubt niggling in the back of his mind.\\nThe Heavy Hand looked crestfallen. He crouched before the weathered statue of Sigmar, its neanderthal countenance worn smooth by an age. The statue’s granite eyes were as stern and knowing as ever, doubtless in a way Gardus envied. How much simpler this matter might be if the Lord of Azyr’s judgement crashed down from the heavens like reinforcements. How much easier if only he told Gardus the truth, and what to do.\\nBut that was not Sigmar’s way. His silence was as meaningful as any words could ever be.\\nGardus could almost hear the sweating substance of Feros’ contemplations. The Retributor-Prime’s nature was to attack his enemy head-on, with little in the way of subtlety to slow him. He was a closed fist colliding with the foe. A hammer to strike, an anvil which would not yield.\\n‘I would speak freely, my lord.’\\nGardus nodded. ‘Always.’\\nFeros rose, like a mountain in motion. ‘The orruks muster – feral, naked. A heaving horde of them, eager to stamp out what civilisation blossoms in these lands. The Steel Souls serve Sigmar, as always. But now more than ever we must be whole of mind and purpose to achieve victory. We are outnumbered. The Claw’s Eye clans and Freeguilds assist us, but they are not Stormcast.’\\n‘I am not oblivious to these considerations.’\\n‘Then imagine what your chamber will say if you accept this healer’s absurd claim and pursue this matter in earnest. You will betray a lack of faith in your own men and women. Warriors who have fought beside you for a century, lord, across the realms. All that is worth something. Accuse us, and the others’ faith in your leadership will fracture when it is needed most. Our victory against those yawling beasts is far from assured, and we are not responsible for these perversions.’\\nGardus wondered what it was like, to feel the certainty Feros felt. ‘I am sorry, brother,’ he said. ‘We owe this to the mortals. I will not let these rumours run rampant uninvestigated.’\\nFeros tensed, some impending massacre lurking beneath the hulk of him. ‘Mortals die every day, my lord. At least out there we can do something about it. Do this, and…’ He gritted his jaw. ‘And the chamber will fracture. I guarantee it.’\\nA horn sounded. An alarm, a call to battle.\\nFeros shot Gardus a miserable scowl. ‘The orruks.’\\nGardus snatched up his tempestos hammer, its massive head snapping with aetheric light, and marched to the shrine’s sandstone threshold. ‘To arms, Heavy Hand. We have nothing more to discuss.’\\nTo call them a sea would have been a tired analogy. They did not surge into the fields, nor gush against the hill. They did not roll up the crags like waves, nor drown the wattle-and-daub outskirts like monsoon rains.\\nThey were savages, and they came like savages, bleeding across the open ground here, clotting together there, baying mindlessly from slavering maws, swinging weapons cobbled from scrap. First they took the outskirts, then the lower bluffs. There, felled by shot and arrows, they dogpiled upon heaps of their own dead, assaulting the walls wherever their gorilla limbs reached, bellowing with crude delight.\\nThe orruk warclans were always the same. They hounded after the biggest fight and hankered for the greatest takedown. It wasn’t honour. It was craving. And once they cracked the bones of Claw’s Eye they would slurp out the marrow within, if they could.\\nGardus and the wardens commanding the walls had laid out a defensive strategy weeks ago. The watch knew their places on the ramparts, in the towers, in the reserves. The Stormcasts reinforced the vulnerable sections. The old fort’s redoubts easily covered each other. The orruks, muscling up the crags like homicidal apes, were exposed wherever they clambered.\\nIf it came to it, the Steel Souls would sally at the gates. There, the bottleneck, the allure of combat and the Stormcasts’ own god-given might would allow them to butcher the orruks at leisure. A breach was unforeseen, the walls were expected to hold.\\nThe orruks broke through in minutes.\\nHere, at least, Gardus’ duty was clear.\\nSteel Souls clad in splendid war plate stormed to the breach. They cast back the slobbering orruks, walling in the mortals’ flanks. Like lodestones, the creatures’ slab-jawed faces and scar-stitched hides attracted blessed hammer and crackling blade. Between pulses of combat, drizzle plinked against the Stormcasts, rinsing mud and ichor from silvered sigmarite plate. Then more orruks surged forward and the breach was doused in butchery again and again.\\nThe defence was straightforward – a matter of strength and stamina, not strategy – so when the battle line began flagging, at first Gardus did not understand.\\nIt was Feros. The Retributors. In battle, the Heavy Hand usually howled with laughter. He would bellow his name, smashing a path from this champion to the next, smiting them one and all. But now his movements were stiff, tired, as if he dragged the chains of the world behind each swing of his hammer. The battle line, so often eager to follow the Heavy Hand’s example, pressed in sluggishly, merely enduring rather than excelling. Doubt had blighted Feros’ zeal like a sickness. It spread through the ranks wherever he was seen.\\n‘Feros!’ Gardus cried, carving closer, his throat blistering, his limbs burning with effort. The Heavy Hand drifted from one press of orruks to the next, stalking with the bitter commitment of a mortal who had seen their own doom. ‘Heavy Hand!’\\nIn the shattered stoneworks, a masked orruk crested the hill – a shaman, with stylised fangs like uneven rock picks lining the porcine maw of its cracked wooden mask. Wicked, vermilion eyes addled with stupid vigour peered out from the splintered visage, beneath a sputtering halo of green power. The thing danced, mad and joyous, rocking from one burly leg to the other and howling the ugly name of its god.\\nWith the haft of his tempestos hammer, Gardus staved in the skull of another orruk. ‘Feros!’\\nThe Heavy Hand snapped around. ‘What?’\\nAll around them, the carnage felt muddled, ungovernable, barely hemmed in by Claw’s Eye’s walls and the battle line. The wet percussion of blades scything into flesh reminded Gardus of the squelch of trudging through mud. Heartened cries and terrified screams filled his ears. Boasts, curses, tears.\\n‘We take the shaman, brother!’ Gardus said. ‘Together!’\\nBut Feros ignored Gardus, returning to his weary butchery.\\nGardus bared his teeth and closed the distance. He jerked the Retributor-Prime back. The chamber was watching; Gardus meant to censure Feros. Much was expected from those to whom much was given, and Feros was faltering.\\nBut when Gardus met Feros’ gaze and stared into the stern sigmarite countenance of their God-King, he hesitated. Something was wrong. Something was terribly wrong.\\nGardus clasped Feros’ arm, wrenching him closer. Their war plate clanged like muted bells. ‘Why this maudlin mood, Feros? Steel yourself. We kill the shaman, and I have faith we shall win this yet.’\\nFeros yanked free. ‘It is good to know you have faith in something, Lord-Celestant.’ He pushed forward again, alone.\\nA moment’s choler urged Gardus to strike him, but it was only a moment. He swivelled to the Retributors loitering in the chaos, deprived of their Prime’s leadership. ‘With me!’\\nGardus turned, then a monumental blast of green energy toppled him back into the Liberators’ battle line.\\nHe scrabbled up. Another meteoric fist of sorcerous, viridescent flame buckled the earth. More fists hammered into the walls around the breach, vaporising mortals on the battlements, sundering the world.\\nHe glanced up. The Retributors. The brunt of the orruk sorcery had slammed right into them.\\nA flash of lightning snatched one from the realm, then another. The fallen paladins seared from the hilltop into the heavens, dead again, to be entombed in Sigmaron’s soul mills until they were remade. In the breach, the masked orruk shaman lurched back and forth, heavy-footed, guffawing madly at the sight of the slaughter.\\nFeros’ pall of melancholy was finally torn away from him. He gazed back from the breach to the smoking ground where his battle brothers had lingered and died. His poisonous mood had spawned this, Gardus knew.\\nBut that was the fruit of Gardus’ doubt.\\nThe Lord-Celestant wrenched his eyes to the still-flagging battle line, to the Stormcasts he had fought beside for a century. The spectre of defeat now hounded them. He had doubted them, too. Just like Feros.\\nHe doubted all of them.\\nThe round door to Omat’s lodgings creaked open. The physician peered out. Beneath her just-washed skirts, Gardus had the impression she was scrubbed clean and parchment dry. Everything about her was disciplined and neat.\\n‘My lord,’ she said softly. ‘I’m told today’s victory was worthy of the God-King.’ She made the sign of the hammer.\\nGardus forced a smile. ‘Always. May I enter?’\\nOmat paled. ‘Now, my lord?’\\nGardus nodded. ‘I seek counsel, healer. This matter with the murders.’\\nShe tugged the door open. ‘I do hope your stomach’s strong, my lord.’\\nGardus latched the door closed behind him. Inside, a fungal reek assailed his senses, bringing tears to his eyes.\\nOn a crooked table beside a painted wall, a dead orruk lay flayed open.\\nThe muscle fibres were pinned apart, its entrails unroped and piled like sausage links. Forest glass bottles and baked clay dishes with various samples surrounded the orruk’s lolling jaw. Toadstools perched in the beast’s scissored-open flesh, gleaming with foetid moisture.\\nGardus bit down. ‘Where did you find this carcass?’\\n‘I assisted the warriors with clearing the dead and burning them,’ she said. ‘The wardens gave me this as my due.’\\nGardus glanced at the precise cuts opening the creature like a rucksack. Omat had a steady hand and a strong stomach. ‘What is this for?’ he asked.\\n‘Research, my lord.’ Omat ambled to a stool beside her dissection table and brandished a journal. A universe of illegible scrawl and meticulous anatomical diagrams filled the pages. ‘At the Lycaeum I was a generalist. I studied astronomy, astrology, biology, mycology…’ She beamed. ‘I send what research I can through the realmgates, or back to Excelsis. They repay the favour. Look at this, lord.’\\nGardus followed. She took a leather-bound book from her sleeping roll – The Hidden Moons of Ulgu: A Treatise on Lunar Phenomena in the Realm of Shadow. Then Gardus looked to the table, to the mushrooms. Medical curiosity swept aside his moment of consternation. Garridan was still down there, somewhere. ‘I have never seen anything like this.’\\nOmat followed his gaze. ‘The fungus? It is unusual, yes. We always knew the brutes had fungal qualities. I assumed these were related.’\\n‘They are not?’\\nOmat shook her head gently. ‘It could be a bloom, from the moisture. Monsoon season, or…’ Something flickered in her eyes. ‘It could be an omen.’\\nGardus stared. An inexpressible impetus moved the healer. She was a woman built around a core of… something. Not her vocation, clearly, not like that doctor who once wore Gardus’ soul.\\nOne way or the other, she reminded Gardus of himself. Of long-lost Garridan, of everything he could have become.\\nOmat chuckled. ‘Science. Sorcery. It’s all rather esoteric, lord, isn’t it? You say you seek my counsel. Let us see if I have any wisdom for a lord of the Stormcasts.’\\nGardus nodded. ‘You’re versed in these murders. Some of the details do not seem to fit. I wanted to query you on them.’\\nOmat ground her teeth. ‘The details. You’re sure it’s not something else, my lord?’\\nGardus gave a weary laugh. ‘These days I am sure of nothing. Pray tell what you have in mind.’\\n‘I watched the battle at dusk from the keep,’ Omat said. ‘I saw those fists crater the earth, and your warriors return to the heavens. You pulled the others together, until the ferals turned tail to the horizon like little patches of algae drifting downstream.’ She placed a gentle hand upon Gardus’ arm. ‘You don’t want to believe one of yours could have done this, lord. They fight for you. They fall for you. You seek anything to prove they didn’t.’\\nGardus regarded her carefully. ‘I have never made a habit of lying to myself. Yes, healer. But I wish to be as certain as you are.’ As certain as Feros was.\\nOmat watched him with the patience and sympathy of one who has lived out her years and seen everything under the sun. ‘You cannot be, lord. Nothing’s ever as certain as we wish it to be. The choice laid out before you is close, but it’s still clear. You don’t see what I see, because no matter what you say, you do not wish to.’ She averted her gaze. ‘Maybe that’s good, my lord. It’s good to believe in something, to do anything to make it true.’\\n‘No,’ Gardus said. ‘This matter taxes me greatly. My duty is to make these troubling decisions.’\\n‘And I think you will, lord. But this isn’t so difficult. It’s simple.’\\nGardus was grave. ‘This is not simple.’\\n‘Well.’ Omat moistened her lips. ‘Perhaps, or perhaps not. But either way, I do not think the man charged with keeping faith with his warriors could have ever let it stay as simple as it should be. The answer lies before you, lord. The talismans found on the bodies come from your Stormcasts. They can be found nowhere else.’\\nGardus recalled the fallen Retributors from the breach. He thought of his Liberators, and all the battles they had won together, and all the battles that would follow. Soon, no matter what he did, the Steel Souls would hear of his doubt. It would haunt them.\\nPerhaps Feros was right. Perhaps a few mortal souls were not worth compromising his brothers’ and sisters’ faith in his leadership. But in his heart, Gardus knew that was wrong. The mortals must be protected, and their trust in Sigmar must be restored.\\nSometimes, when Gardus closed his eyes, he could only see the dead. He would do anything for there to be fewer of them.\\n‘In my profession, we have an old saying,’ Omat said. ‘The simplest answers are the most likely to be true. If you think one of yours did it, they did. Trust your instincts, lord. In the end you have nothing else.’\\nGardus walked the broken belt of Claw’s Eye’s walls, surveying the defences as the mortals prepared for the battles ahead. Raindrops tap-danced irresolutely against his armour. The rain was forever, chinkling in the floodplains, padding against the earth, drizzling from here to there and back again, coming and going as it pleased.\\nHe glared into the diaphanous darkness, at the glowing pyres of orruk carcasses in the outskirts. Freeguilders buried their fallen. The Claw’s Eye clans collected theirs but left the sigmarite talismans for the Ghurish earth. With the mystery of the recent killings unsolved, the seed of doubt in Sigmar and his chosen had been sown in Claw’s Eye. What would grow from it, Gardus did not want to know.\\nInside, more refugees flooded Claw’s Eye’s innards. The hill fort’s defence was as imperative as it had ever been. So was discovering the truth about the murders.\\nOmat was so certain she had the answers. Feros, too.\\nGardus was certain of nothing.\\nTrue faith didn’t exist in a vacuum – that was the dogma of cruel war priests and masochistic flagellants. Blind belief was poison. The Hallowed Knights’ faith in Sigmar was not an immovable rock but a river flowing in constant renewal. Not a hill to die upon but a banner to be defended, flown where it was needed most, even stowed if the circumstances so demanded.\\nBut that was faith in Sigmar. Never before had Gardus considered his faith in his chamber and their faith in him, that was always presupposed. Reforging, for all its flaws, was also considered a passed trial. The Stormcasts had Sigmar’s blessing. Their trust in each other was never meant to be questioned, only taken for granted. In an age of war, such confidence in one’s brethren was the burning substance of triumph.\\nNow, Gardus’ faith in his warriors was rattled and fragile, like a temple’s settling foundations after an earthquake. And theirs in him, too.\\nHow could he repair that trust? Where did he even start?\\nPausing on the battlements, Gardus sensed something. Light within, pressing its way to his flesh: a ripeness eager to burst.\\nThis feeling was not new. Starlight shone in Gardus like a captive sun in the void of who he had once been. Sometimes he felt like an old ship, restored plank by plank, freshly tarred with a just-woven sail. Beautiful, new, in the way things touched by divinity are, but utterly distinct from whatever preceded him, no matter how similar he appeared.\\nMuch was expected from those to whom much was given, Gardus knew. But never before had he felt so unworthy of his power – his burden. Never before had the captured starlight shining within him so little resembled grace.\\nReforging. That was the problem. Gardus’ doubt in Reforging was his doubt in everything. In Sigmar, in himself, in his warriors. He had always trusted the process before. With Omat’s tidings, that faith had fractured. Unabated, this blight could persist far into future wars and campaigns. The Steel Souls could not truly die, and so they would never forget. Neither would Gardus.\\nThis is not the enemy I was meant to fight, he thought.\\nBut here, Gardus himself was his own, sole enemy.\\nA cirrus veil blocked the light of the stars. When the monsoon season ended, the twinkling aether would wash away the overcast weather. Ghur’s Beast-Moons and feast-honoured constellations would return. The realm would shift, and then would come the ever-constant light of Hysh, the sun of all worlds. Of these things at least, Gardus was certain.\\nThat was the beauty of faith. Test it, try it. Suffocate it for a time if need be. The light would pierce the clouds before the end, just as always, and Gardus’ belief would only be stronger.\\nHe knew what he must do.\\n‘I have tarried. And for that I pray your forgiveness.’\\nIn Claw’s Eye’s shrine the assembled Steel Souls stood shoulder to shoulder before Gardus, motionless under the beastly countenance of their God-King.\\n‘Our brotherhood and faith in Sigmar have always bound us,’ Gardus said. ‘Yet there are times when my duty requires decisions with which I would never burden any of you. Come forward, Feros of the Heavy Hand.’\\nThe others parted to make way. Feros lowered his hammer to the stone with a sonorous thud. ‘My lord.’\\n‘Remove your helm.’\\nBeneath the fortress of his armour, Feros hesitated. Then he slid his helm free. His face was the picture of grief, his lips a tense cut in his bearded jaw. Feros had lost his Retributors today. Brothers, sisters. Gardus would not let him lose anything else.\\n‘I know of what you whisper to the others.’ Gardus’ tone held no rage, for he was not angry. No spite, for he resented nothing. Where doubt once clung, resolve now blazed. ‘Tell me what you told them.’\\n‘Of the murders, my lord.’ Feros’ bass growl bordered on insubordinate, but it was only the sound of faith shaken. ‘I told them of your suspicions. Your plan to investigate our chamber, to prove our innocence to the mortals.’\\nThe words rippled through the Stormcasts. Helmets clinked against breastplates as heads were lowered in ignominy.\\nThe time had come to settle this. Gardus brandished the hammer of his gaze at his immortals. ‘Who among you believes us incapable of such evil? Who among you – knowing what you know, having endured what you have endured – believes us above all fault?’\\nThe slash and tear of guttering flames in the wall sconces filled the thick air.\\nGardus turned to Feros. ‘Did you think I would not question my own chamber, with signs as certain as these? Do you think I would not question our honour, to protect the mortals?’\\nFeros peered down. Shame burdened him like a mantle.\\n‘For a century we have battled side by side across the Mortal Realms,’ said Gardus. ‘We protect Sigmar’s faithful wherever we tread. We lay low his enemies and purge darkness from the corners of the world. Not once have I ever truly questioned you, and not once will I ever. I believe in all of you. My trust in this chamber is complete.’\\nA pulse of hammers on stone electrified the air. The Steel Souls murmured, heartened.\\nFeros fought back a smile. ‘Yes, my lord.’\\nGardus’ gaze softened. ‘Feros, brother. If my hesitation raised your own doubts in me, forgive me. I am not perfect, and I see this now. Yet we are Hallowed Knights. Without such moments of doubt, what would our faith mean?’ Gardus extended his arm.\\nFeros, grinning, clasped it.\\nOmat sauntered through the shrine’s threshold, and the Steel Souls’ hammers ceased their chant on the stone.\\nGardus’ gaze fell upon her. Omat had thought no one would see her for what she was. She had almost been right.\\nThe healer wavered. ‘I was summoned. By…’\\nGardus was reminded of a worm squirming in mud, its stone upturned. ‘Steel Souls, behold. The killer I seek.’\\nLiberators drew to Omat’s flanks.\\n‘I-I didn’t kill anybody!’ she stammered.\\nGardus approached, his heels thudding ponderously against the stone. ‘The Steel Souls were not the only ones present in each place where innocents were slain. You were there, too. With the sigmarite talismans you took from the dead after each of our battles – the talismans you used to frame us. Nobody questioned you, and I saw so much of myself in you, I didn’t stop to think. But you said it yourself, Omat. The simplest answer is most likely to be true.’\\nOmat licked her lips. ‘I was helping, lord. I told you.’\\n‘No. You were caught by Claw’s Eye’s watch, and you crafted these lies to save yourself.’\\nOmat stammered something else, but it was pointless. Gardus trusted his instincts. She could say a thousand things – a thousand silver-tongued, polished alibis, and each one he’d scrape away as deceit until only the wriggling creature of her utter falsehood remained.\\nFeros tramped forward. ‘The Ghur-daughter lies. Uther, Q’umon – seize her.’\\nOmat bolted outside. Two Liberators thundered after her, then recoiled at a sheen of sickly light glowing in the threshold.\\nGardus followed. Outside, an awful lustre oozed from the night sky. Ill, ghastly green, the shade of absinthe and wormwood and the manic mind.\\nGardus raised his eyes and saw the source of the glow. He regretted ever looking.\\nThere, like an ulcer in the firmament – a gurning moon.\\nNever had Gardus seen such a hideous visage. The moon’s eyes were uneven saucers, bent and sleepless, girded with mountainous bags and fissured with canyon veins of green. A sick rictus carved open the hemisphere of the moon’s jaw – for this moon had jaws and a wrecking-ball smile – better suited to some raving grot fanatic gyrating across a battlefield than a sacred celestial body.\\nBut this moon was not sacred, only mad, and when Gardus blinked, it swelled closer, leering. This was no Beast-Moon. This was a wicked moon, a freak of un-sanity, un-sense, un-reason. A hateful, deranged, spiteful moon, with evil thoughts and evil needs.\\nA Bad Moon – as bad as they came.\\nRompalicious, gambolific lunacy scratched at the bastion of Gardus’ will. The Bad Moon urged him to cavort down into Claw’s Eye’s caves, to wrench mortals apart by their fingers and toes. A narcotic hunger for violence frisked through him, an impulse, like an invasive spore from the ribs of fungus now rupturing from the hill fort’s bedrock, punching out from within the stone of its walls.\\nThe madness sought purchase in Gardus, too, to sink its raving rot into the crannies of his mind.\\nBut Gardus was blessed by the stuff of Sigmar, and to this madness the Stormcast Eternals could not succumb. He had doubted. Now he knew. Mortals might be vulnerable to such sick magicks, but not the Steel Souls.\\nOmat spasmed, worshipping the death of reason in the sky.‘So long!’ she bleated. ‘I killed in Aqshy, calling you… I killed in Ghyran, calling you… In all the realms… Cutting… Slicing… Ripping… Chopping! Pretending I was like them. Pretending I didn’t know you! But you’re back! Back, at last! Back, to me!’\\nGardus recalled Omat’s story. She had survived an atrocity, out collecting mushrooms as a girl, with her brother.\\nThis is what she saw that night – the Bad Moon. In all the time since, she had sought its return. Lunacy was her reward…\\nAnd death.\\nOmat’s washed and wrinkleless skin folded, creased, bulged. Ugly toadstools punched their fat fingertips through her mottling flesh. The shell of her skull cracked. Mushrooms peeked from jiggling brain tissue through wisps of greying hair. Her bleating tantrum sloughed apart into meaningless syllables. Her tongue exploded in a spore-ridden mess. Stems of scowling fungi pushed her open until she came apart with a slobbering squelch.\\nInside Claw’s Eye, in the caverns below, there came shrieks and cackles. Shadows beneath the shrine crawled with the movement of grots and their monstrous pets. Refugees scurried upward, screaming in fear, to the Stormcasts and Sigmar’s shrine. The creatures capered after them, sharp-eared and dagger-nosed, wicked iron blades gripped between their razor-nail fingers. The caves below ran deep; they must have connected to the grots’ dank lairs.\\n‘More on the walls,’ Feros said. Gardus spied them – grots pouring through the breach, spiders heaving over the battlements. The touch of moonlight killed many among the defences, petrifying watchmen into mushrooms, bursting soldiers in sickening, anticlimactic puffs of spores.\\nThey were everywhere. Toothy squigs. Rambling grots with rusty scrap weapons. They came from the walls, from the caverns, up the stoneways, towards the shrine. Larger monsters pounded in the darkness, and then troggoths lumbered out into the Bad Moon’s glow.\\nInnocents fled through a gap in the just-formed Stormcasts’ line, packing into the shrine. Gardus caught sight of the weeping woman from the mule-pulled cart that morning in the mudfields of Gandy. She stole past with her children, frantic.\\nFeros slammed the haft of his lightning hammer into his open palm. ‘Grots and orruks until my death. Another stinking horde of them. Some of us may not survive the night, my lord.’\\n‘No.’ A smile warmed Gardus’ lips. ‘Only the faithful.’\\nFeros laughed, then bellowed, ‘Forward, insects! To me! To the Heavy Hand! I will give you the end you crave!’\\nGrots surrounded the Steel Souls, closing in from above and below.\\nThe Stormcasts were outnumbered. Surrounded.\\nAt last. The war they were forged for.\\n\\n\\n'"
